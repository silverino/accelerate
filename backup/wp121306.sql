On August 18th, an email was sent to users who signed up to <a href="https://dotblog.wordpress.com/">Dotblog.WordPress.com</a> notifying them that they could apply and secure a .blog domain name before November 21st.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ApplyForBlogDomain.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-63953" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ApplyForBlogDomain.png?resize=480%2C781&ssl=1" alt="Applying For a Domain Name" /></a>Applying For a Domain Name\n<p><a href="http://chrisschidle.com">Chris Schidle</a> took advantage of the opportunity and secured chris.blog for $30 per year with a $220 application fee. People who apply for a domain only receive it if no one else applies for it. If there are multiple applications, the domain goes through an auction process between November 14-17.</p>\n<p>As the auction dates drew nearer and Schidle didn&#8217;t receive any information concerning the auction, he contacted support. Support confirmed that his application was not successful and he received a refund on November 15th. After asking support about the auction process, Schidle was informed that chris.blog ended up on a list of reserved domains that were not available for registration.</p>\n<p>In a blog post entitled &#8220;<a href="http://chrisschidle.com/the-dot-blog-bait-and-switch/">The .blog Bait and Switch&#8221;</a>, Schidle expressed disappointment in Automattic&#8217;s lack of communication. &#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s not fair to call this bait and switch,&#8221; Schidle said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Really it was bait and refund, and certainly the situation would be far worse had they chosen to not make the application fee refundable.

Belcastro says that as a registrar, they&#8217;re able to activate up to 100 domain names. Some of the domains were given to <a href="https://my.blog/founders/">third-parties</a> and 25 generic domains were given to WordPress.com to be shared for free with millions of users.</p>\n<p>The registrar reserved all one, two, and three-character domains from being registered. They also allowed Automattic employees to reserve a single domain each, some of which were first names.</p>\n<p>On behalf of .blog, Belcastro apologized to those who filed applications in August and later discovered the domains were not available.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many registrars started taking pre-registrations for the Landrush period as early as last August. We do realize that some users were disappointed when they discovered that the domain names they had applied for were in fact attributed as part of the Founder’s program, or reserved, and wouldn’t be possible to register or auction at the end of Landrush.</p>\n<p>We would like to apologize to these users, but as the lists of Founder domains and Reserved ones weren’t final until just before Landrush, we couldn’t communicate them to registrars in advance (there is nothing registrars hate more than ever-changing lists of reserved domains).</p>\n<p>In addition, domains were removed as well as added to the lists, and we didn’t want to take the risk for registrars to refuse applications in September for domains that would be released in October.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To mitigate the uncertainty surrounding domain availability, fees were set up in a way so that only successful registrations would be charged. This provided a way to give full refunds to those with failed applications.</p>\n<p>Schidle appreciates the company&#8217;s apology, &#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate that their reserved domain list wasn&#8217;t finalized prior to accepting applications, and that affected applicants like myself weren&#8217;t notified sooner (auctions were scheduled to begin on November 14th),&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I think they realize their mistake in handling that communication and their apology is appreciated.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 00:03:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: WordPress Passes 27% Market Share, Banks on Customizer for Continued Success";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63735";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-passes-27-market-share-banks-on-customizer-for-continued-success";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18465:"<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-brushes.jpg?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-brushes.jpg?resize=960%2C510&ssl=1" alt="photo credit: Luis Llerena" class="size-full wp-image-63978" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/265GAALCWG">Luis Llerena</a>\n<p>WordPress now powers <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all" target="_blank">27.1% of all websites on the internet</a>, up from 25% last year. While it may seem that WordPress is neatly adding 2% of the internet every year, its percentage increase fluctuates from year to year and the climb is getting more arduous with more weight to haul.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wordpress-market-share.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wordpress-market-share.png?resize=1025%2C256&ssl=1" alt="credit: w3techs.com" class="size-full wp-image-63933" /></a>credit: <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all/y">w3techs.com</a>\n<p>In January 2015, Mullenweg said the next goal for WordPress was <a href="https://wptavern.com/how-important-is-jetpack-on-wordpress-road-to-50-market-share" target="_blank">to achieve 50% market share</a> (the majority of websites) and he identified Jetpack as a key factor in preventing WordPress&#8217; decline, a controversial statement delivered at Pressnomics. At that time Automattic was secretly working on <a href="https://wptavern.com/early-reviews-show-applications-like-calypso-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">Calypso</a>, WordPress.com&#8217;s JavaScript-powered interface, but did not unveil the project until November 2015.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to say what effect Calypso has had on WordPress&#8217; market share, as the w3tech&#8217;s 27% stat covers mostly self-hosted sites. Following up with him a year later, Mullenweg estimates that less than 10% of those sites are hosted on WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It does look like about a quarter of it is using Jetpack, though, and that has grown since Calypso was released,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Remember &#8211; Calypso is for Jetpack sites as well as WP.com.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href="https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-240-interview-with-matt-mullenweg-2016" target="_blank">interview on WPWeekly</a>, Mullenweg said he is also optimistic that the WooCommerce acquisition and <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-to-oversee-the-sale-and-registration-of-top-level-blog-domains" target="_blank">Automattic&#8217;s sale and management of the .blog domain</a> extension will contribute &#8220;another 5-10% each to that market share.&#8221; In fact, there is a team inside Automattic called Team 51 that works on strategies for getting the market share to 51%.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For getting to 51% and beyond &#8211; it&#8217;s more than just blogs and more than just websites,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We need to do stores well, we need to do wikis well, we need to do real estate sites well, we need to do restaurants well &#8211; all these things that may be outside what you normally think of as a core WP experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In order to provide the best content-creation experience on the market, in any niche, WordPress has some major work to do. The software is in imminent danger of being eclipsed by newer competitors if its core features don&#8217;t improve, especially when it comes to customizing a new site. Jetpack cannot single-handedly solve WordPress&#8217; onboarding problem.</p>\n<h3>WordPress&#8217; Weakest Link Is Also Its Greatest Opportunity</h3>\n<p>In the past Mullenweg has identified customization as the weakest link in WordPress but also one of its most important areas for improvement, saying, &#8220;The Customizer is everything.&#8221; During the <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">2015 State of the Word</a> address he said, &#8220;Customization is the single biggest opportunity for improving the WordPress experience.&#8221; I asked him if he thinks the necessary improvements to make the software more competitive need to come from core itself or if commercial products could introduce game changers for the Customizer, the editor, and other problem areas of WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think to have an impact on WordPress&#8217; growth improvements to customization have to happen in core or Calypso/Jetpack, otherwise there isn&#8217;t enough reach,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter how great a commercial product is &#8211; being behind a paywall will mean it won&#8217;t reach enough people to make a dent in WP&#8217;s growth curve.&#8221; He outlined how he sees the Customizer as a critical component of WordPress&#8217; future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think the needed improvements will only come from a customizer and theme system which is flexible, intuitive, and instantaneous, which might also need to break backwards compatibility, and a post editor which leverages the same language, patterns, interface, and concepts. We need to use and adopt a React / Redux approach to the javascript, like Calypso, and rename or make irrelevant concepts like Menus which are just plain confusing to people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Customizer improvements have been a focus throughout 2016 and the feature&#8217;s small team of contributors have made major strides towards improving the underlying architecture to build upon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <em>customization</em> that is the key need here, not necessarily the existing &#8216;Customizer&#8217; interface that we have today,&#8221; <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/components/customize/" target="_blank">Customize</a> component maintainer Weston Ruter said. &#8220;The key need WordPress has is to be able to live preview more functionality in WordPress, as Helen tweeted here:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What if instead of opposing "shoving more stuff into the customizer" we supported "adding live previews to WordPress functionality"?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Helen 侯-Sandí (@helenhousandi) <a href="https://twitter.com/helenhousandi/status/778255682462183424">September 20, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href="https://wptavern.com/customizer-responsive-preview-and-selective-refresh-to-be-merged-into-wordpress-4-5" target="_blank">Selective refresh</a> was added earlier this year in 4.5, giving WordPress the ability to preview elements without full page reloads. This is one way the Customize API addresses that &#8220;instantaneous&#8221; aspect Mullenweg outlined above.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The <a href="https://make.xwp.co/2016/04/29/customize-posts-v0-5-released/" target="_blank">Customize Posts</a> plugin is an effort to rebuild the post editor from the ground up with live preview for all changes to post data and postmeta at the foundation,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a JavaScript-first approach to the post editing experience. No more waiting for a full page reload to save a draft. No more clicking a preview button to load the post in a new window. All of the changes are saved as drafts and previewed live. It&#8217;s reusing the TinyMCE editor component.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress may be looking at <a href="https://wptavern.com/customize-posts-plugin-and-selective-refresh-are-paving-the-way-for-front-end-editing-powered-by-the-customizer" target="_blank">front-end editing powered by the Customizer</a> in the not-too-distant future. Ruter and contributors are also working towards using the Customize API to power the next generation of widgets in core, which would use JS for UI and open the door for widgets to be managed via the REST API.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Changesets, coming in 4.7, is the most far-reaching architectural improvement to the customizer since its inception,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;Changesets allow for live preview functionality to be de-coupled from the current Customizer interface. This architecture allows for live preview to be developed in other contexts, namely on the frontend and in REST API-driven apps and headless sites.&#8221; Ruter anticipates the REST API endpoints for managing changesets to come in 4.8.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-js-widgets" target="_blank">WP JS Widgets</a> project shifts widgets away from their heavy reliance on PHP and creates a JavaScript foundation in the Customizer that allows for any library to be used to build widget controls.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A control can actually be implemented using any JS technology stack,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;In the JS Widgets plugin I have a demonstration of widget controls in the customizer being built using the customizer Element, Backbone.js, and also React.&#8221; The plugin currently implements <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-js-widgets/tree/master/php/widgets" target="_blank">three core widgets</a> and contributors are working on more.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s somewhat of a &#8216;Widgets 3.0&#8217; in core, focused on what they would look like in the Customizer first,&#8221; Ruter said, &#8220;where the widget instance data is stored in a setting, and the control listens to changes to that setting and updates its UI to reflect the changes in the underlying instance data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although this particular project is being built to be JavaScript-library agnostic, Ruter said he thinks there would be value in exploring the use of React/Redux in a “Customizer 2.0” interface:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It would be great to experiment with re-implementing the Customizer UI (pane, panels, sections, controls) in React. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Weston Ruter ⚡ (@westonruter) <a href="https://twitter.com/westonruter/status/672830761872064513">December 4, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Taking the Customizer Beyond First Impressions</h3>\n<p>Ruter said he would have a difficult time proposing to build a client site that depended on the WordPress admin for site management and content authorship.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of the work we&#8217;ve done at XWP for the past few years has been building on the Customizer to provide the editorial experiences that I think are lacking in the WP admin,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;We invest heavily in the customizer because we see it as the best foundation that WordPress has to offer to provide the experiences we want to deliver to our clients.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If the Customizer is so critical to WordPress&#8217; success, it&#8217;s curious that the contributor team remains relatively small and few companies are investing in the feature specifically. <a href="https://xwp.co/" target="_blank">XWP</a> invests heavily in Customizer development and a great deal of that is prototype work in the form of feature plugins such as Customize Snapshots, Customize Posts, and several <a href="https://github.com/xwp?q=wp-customize" target="_blank">other plugin projects</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know for sure why more developers across the WordPress community aren&#8217;t doing more with the customizer,&#8221; said Ruter, who is CTO at XWP. &#8220;It may be in part a perception problem, where it has seemingly been stuck with a negative reputation. Or it could be a technology problem, where the Customizer is vastly different from other areas of WordPress being a JavaScript single-page application.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When the Customizer was first introduced it included support for &#8216;option&#8217; and &#8216;theme_mod,&#8217; followed by widgets and navigation menus a bit down the road. The WordPress community didn&#8217;t have a full understanding of the scope and capabilities of the Customizer for addressing some of the project&#8217;s chief concerns, including content authorship with live previews. Users simply saw a constrained UI they didn&#8217;t like using to customize themes. Most users had no concept of the Customizer providing the architectural underpinnings of other aspects of WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of the problem is a lack of contributors,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;But even more than that, the biggest problem is one of having a shared vision. When the WP community throws hate on customizer improvements with each new release, it&#8217;s somewhat demotivating.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If the community realized the vision behind and appreciated a full admin experience that had live preview and staging of changes, then that would make a huge difference,&#8221; Ruter said. He and contributors find it challenging to articulate the scope and they are considerably short-handed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It could be a problem with getting ramped up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But that&#8217;s been the mandate for the WP community as a whole &#8211; to learn JavaScript deeply. I say, why not learn JavaScript deeply by building on the customizer?&#8221;</p>\n<h3>GoDaddy Plans to Invest in Core Customizer Improvements</h3>\n<p>GoDaddy is a surprising company to emerge over the past couple of years as another key player on WordPress&#8217; road to 50% market share. WordPress product and service companies, along with hosts, are keenly interested in seeing the software continue its market dominance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very important to GoDaddy that WP market share increases,&#8221; Gabe Mays, head of WordPress products at GoDaddy, said. &#8220;We&#8217;re deeply invested in the success of the WordPress community, not only because many of our customers use it, but also because of what it represents.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mays reports that approximately 1/3 of all GoDaddy sites and half of all new sites are running on WordPress. With millions of customers using the software, the company took the initiative to create a new <a href="https://wptavern.com/godaddy-launches-new-onboarding-experience-for-wordpress-customers" target="_blank">onboarding experience specifically for WordPress customers</a>. I asked Mays if GoDaddy is concerned about competitors like Wix and Weebly cutting into the WordPress market share.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if &#8216;worry&#8217; is the right word, because 1) we know the problem and 2) we&#8217;re capable of addressing it,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;As a community we either care enough to fix it or we don&#8217;t. There are negative consequences associated with the latter that pose an existential threat to the community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mays has been involved with the WordPress community for the past 10 years and is working with GoDaddy to improve the new user experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of the issue we’re experiencing now is that WordPress benefitted from such strong product market fit and, subsequently, such high growth that there weren’t the typical feedback mechanisms forcing us to make things like the UX better,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;On the other hand, our competitors fought hard and iterated for every basis point of market share they have. We’re like that natural athlete that got to the top with natural talent, but now need to master the basics, get our form right, etc. to stay on top as the game changes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s new onboarding experience is a stab at improving this UX and Mays said the company has significant WordPress core improvements in the works to provide a better first-use experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m happy to say we’ll also be contributing these improvements back to core,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re happy to have had Aaron Campbell join us as our first core contributor earlier this year and we&#8217;re working on more ways to accelerate our core contribution efforts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mays said GoDaddy is planning to submit core contributions to the Customizer and related core components in the near future but would not disclose any specifics at this time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hosts benefit immensely from WordPress and as hosts we can collectively do a lot more to move WordPress forward,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;We want to lead by example here and have big plans for this in 2017.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress product and service companies are also deeply invested in the software&#8217;s success and eager to see its market share grow. Cory Miller, CEO of <a href="https://ithemes.com/" target="_blank">iThemes</a>, one of WordPress&#8217; earliest theme companies, said growth is one potential sign of WordPress&#8217; health.</p>\n<p>“As WordPress has grown, so have we with it,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;The opposite of growth is scary — it’s stagnation or decline. Many have predicted that in WordPress for a long time, but it continues to grow and push new limits, like the defiant teenager it is.”</p>\n<p>Miller said one of his concerns with competitors in the space is that they have started to cut into the lower  or lowest end of the market, &#8220;the do-it-yourselfers that many of us count as a key part of our customer base.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress is fantastic, and so are all the innovative tools and services around it, from themes, plugins to hosting,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;But I&#8217;m increasingly seeing the reason why many, on perhaps the bottom end of the market, say, &#8216;I don’t want to mess with updates, or worrying about security, or pulling 15 separate tools together to do what I need. I just want a simple website, I want everything in one bundle, mostly done for me, and so I’ll just go with SquareSpace or Weebly.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although WordPress provides so much more in terms of community and extensibility when compared to Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace, getting started is the hardest part for new users. This is where tools like Jetpack and GoDaddy&#8217;s onboarding experience are useful for giving users what they need to succeed with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Even with a strong background in HTML and CSS, customizing a WordPress site can be challenging. Your site will never feel like your home on the web if you struggle to customize it to suit your preferences. The good news is that the WordPress project lead, contributors, hosts, and product companies are working together to improve customization in different, complementary ways in order to ensure the future of the project in an increasingly competitive market.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 22:48:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"WPTavern: 2nd Global WordPress Translation Day Brings 780 Translators Together Across 133 Locales";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63915";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:108:"https://wptavern.com/2nd-global-wordpress-translation-day-brings-780-translators-together-across-133-locales";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6919:"<p>The second <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/" target="_blank">Global WordPress Translation Day</a> was held November 12 and the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2016/11/16/notes-from-the-polyglots-chats-on-november-16th/" target="_blank">stats</a> released this week show the event was an even greater success than the first one.

Attendance at the local events increased from 39 in April to 67 in November.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looking at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WPTranslationDay?src=hash">#WPTranslationDay</a> stats I can’t be more grateful to <a href="https://twitter.com/humanmadeltd">@humanmadeltd</a> for supporting my time for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash">#WordPress</a> Polyglots.

Participants had the opportunity to discuss the upcoming internationalization features in WordPress with core developers, including a session by Pascal Birchler and a panel led by John Blackbourn. Translators also discussed gender neutral languages in the WordPress UI, prompted by a discussion around gender neutral German.</p>\n<p>Raykovska said one of the goals of the second event was to &#8220;bring more people on screen so everyone can feel like they&#8217;re a part of a truly global event.&#8221; Local participation for the live streaming meetups increased from April.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The activities in India have kept their strong growth rate &#8211; we had eight events last time, this time they were 14, with Mumbai even having two events,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;For the first time we had events in Russia and in South Africa.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Raykovska said she&#8217;s hoping the Polyglots Leadership Team will soon begin developing events in African regions, following patterns of success in Asia and Europe.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/ResellerClub">@ResellerClub</a> for hosting us today for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WPTranslationday?src=hash">#WPTranslationday</a> <a href="https://t.co/vfr9l0D50V">pic.twitter.com/vfr9l0D50V</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp Mumbai (@WCMumbai) <a href="https://twitter.com/WCMumbai/status/797397743467659264">November 12, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Global WordPress Translation Day Expands Into South Africa</h3>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cape-town-wptranslation-day.jpg?ssl=1"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cape-town-wptranslation-day.jpg?resize=1025%2C548&ssl=1" alt="Cape Town WP Translation Day - credit: Jon Bossenger" class="size-full wp-image-63927" /></a>Cape Town WP Translation Day &#8211; credit: <a href="https://wpcapetown.co.za/2016/11/14/wordpress-global-translation-day-recap/">Jon Bossenger</a>\n<p>South Africa has 11 languages and Raykovska said the event gave a big boost to the translation community there, with Xhosa being translated for WordPress for the first time. Xhosa is spoken by 7.6 million people, which is approximately 18% of the South African population.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Africa has a huge potential and a lot of wonderful, enthusiastic people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There will be more WordCamps there in 2017 and hopefully more activity on the translation side.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jon Bossenger and Hugh Lashbrooke, who co-organized the Cape Town event, had attendees translating WordPress into Xhosa, Sotho, and Setswana.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By the end of the day we had two translation files for these languages that we’ll be looking to submit requests to be added as locales for WordPress,&#8221; Bossenger said in his recap <a href="https://wpcapetown.co.za/2016/11/14/wordpress-global-translation-day-recap/" target="_blank">post</a>. &#8220;We’re almost halfway towards adding all 11 official languages, just in one day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Trisha Cornelius, co-organizer the WP Johannesburg Meetup, organized the in-person translation event in Johannesburg where the team made major progress and assisted the Cape Town team in getting their languages started.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We managed to get Xhosa approved in time for us to translate some strings for our translation day event,&#8221; Cornelius said. &#8220;We translated into Afrikaans (which is at over 95% so we are pushing to get to 100%) and South African English as well. People who were at the Cape Town event have volunteered to become translators for Tswana and an attendee at our event has volunteered to become GTE for Zulu.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cornelius said the excitement of live streaming and connecting with Cape Town and others around the world could have easily made for an event that spanned longer than three hours.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The biggest success was in showing people how easy translation is,&#8221; Cornelius said. She hopes the translations will make WordPress easier for more people in South Africa and help more people get onto the web.</p>\n<p>&#8220;South Africa has an interesting case in that we have a clear racial split between being multi-lingual and not,&#8221; Cornelius said. &#8220;The majority of our population speaks English/Afrikaans as a second language and I would love to see WordPress available in all 11 of our official languages so that WP users can choose to use WP in their mother tongue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cornelius said language accessibility in South Africa is less of a challenge than actual access to computers with the Internet, but they are making progress in Johannesburg to make the internet more widely available.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Especially with the prevalence of smart phones, I think having WordPress in more indigenous languages will mean that we are able to hear more of each others voices which we desperately need,&#8221; Cornelius said.</p>\n<p>Overall, the WordPress Translation Day participants translated a total of 60,426 strings, up from 40,350 in April. This includes popular plugins and themes in addition to WordPress core.

In an effort to see if the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27403">same could be done</a> for the self-hosted version of WordPress, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27403#comment:16">Payton Swick open sourced</a> Automattic&#8217;s work into a plugin and <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/customize-direct-manipulation">placed it on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>The plugin added persistent icons to show users which parts of a site can be customized when the customizer preview pane is open. After months of collaboration between Automatticians and the Customize component maintainers, the icons were merged into WordPress 4.7 and are officially called visible edit shortcuts. The icons visually inform users which elements can be edited in a theme.</p>\n<p>The icons appear when the customizer is open and directs users to settings that control an element. For example, clicking the icon next to the site tagline in the image below opens the Site Identity section of the customizer and makes the Tagline field active. Visible shortcuts are an extension of the Shift-click to edit keyboard shortcut that was added in WordPress 3.9.</p>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CustomizerShortcutButtons.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-63883" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CustomizerShortcutButtons.png?resize=1025%2C544&ssl=1" alt="Visible Edit Shortcut Buttons" /></a>Visible Edit Shortcut Buttons\n<p>The icon approach was largely inspired by WordPress.com which has a similar feature in its customizer. Nick Halsey, Customize component maintainer, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/10/visible-edit-shortcuts-in-the-customizer-preview/">describes in detail</a> the history of the feature and what theme authors need to do to support it.</p>\n<p>Unlike many of the theme specific updates in the past where developers can add support by using add_theme_support, supporting visible edit shortcuts is more comprehensive. Theme authors will need to add support for <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/16/selective-refresh-in-the-customizer/">selective refresh</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/22/implementing-selective-refresh-support-for-widgets/">selective refresh for widgets</a>, and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/29/fast-previewing-changes-to-menus-in-the-customizer/">selective refresh for menus</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Edit shortcuts will be enabled by default for all themes, but are contingent on themes supporting selective refresh,&#8221; Halsey said. Additionally, a small amount of CSS may be required to properly position the icons.</p>\n<p>Adding visual elements that connect parts of a theme to the customizer should take some of the guesswork out of editing themes. Instead of spending time browsing through various customizer panels to edit a part of a site, users can click a button and the right customizer panel will open automatically with the settings you need. This can be especially useful for themes that have a lot of customizer sections.</p>\n<p>I tested visible edit shortcuts using the Twenty Seventeen theme in WordPress 4.7 beta 4 and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues. The team is strongly encouraging users to test with as many themes as possible. If you use a theme where the shortcut icons are not displayed, please contact the theme author, request that they add support, and refer them to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/10/visible-edit-shortcuts-in-the-customizer-preview/">the make core blog post which explains how to do so</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 08:54:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"WPTavern: Nashville to Host WordCamp US 2017-2018";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63871";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"https://wptavern.com/nashville-to-host-wordcamp-us-2017-2018";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5593:"<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nashville.jpg?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nashville.jpg?resize=1015%2C524&ssl=1" alt="photo credit: Viv Lynch Westward - (license)" class="size-full wp-image-63884" /></a>photo credit: Viv Lynch <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68894626@N00/30070498810">Westward</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p><a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp US</a> attendees are counting down the days until the event kicks off in Philadelphia in two weeks but preparations for 2017 and 2018 are already underway. Yesterday Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordcamp-us-2017-2018-in-nashville/" target="_blank">announced</a> that Nashville has won the bid to host WordCamp US for the next two years. According to Randy Hicks, one of the organizers, the new <a href="http://www.nashvillemusiccitycenter.com/" target="_blank">Music City Center</a> venue, which was finished in 2013, has been reserved from Thursday, November 30, 2017, to Sunday, December 3 but the camp will take place Friday &#8211; Sunday. The venue has confirmed the ability to host 3,000 &#8211; 5,000 attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a brand new venue that is pretty amazing but Nashville is very centrally located to handful of other cities that all have their own WordCamps,&#8221; Hicks said. &#8220;I think there are about seven camps within 4-5 hours. The WP community around Nashville is rather strong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Over the past few years the local WordPress community has grown and WordCamp Nashville sold 325 tickets at its 2016 event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been coming to the meetups since the very first one and have been an organizer since about the same time as well as John Housholder,&#8221; Hicks said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the community explode every year after WordCamp, but 2014 and 2015 have been huge growth years for Nashville as a whole and the meetup has reflected those numbers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The application process included nailing down a venue, creating a budget, and gathering specific details about wifi capabilities, room capabilities, hotel availability, and date availability. Organizers from both the Nashville team and the Denver team (another finalist) agreed that the application time frame was somewhat constrained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought the time frame between start and submission was pretty short, but I think that depends on who is submitting and how informed they are on their local venue,&#8221; Hicks said. &#8220;Ours was really hard to get information from.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Denver team had a similar struggle with locking down a venue without certainty of being able to fully book the reservation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was what I would consider to be a semi-fanatical obsession with the first weekend in December, which was flatly unavailable at the convention center here,&#8221; said Drew Jaynes, one of the organizers who applied on behalf of Denver.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To give you some perspective, at the time that we applied, March 2016, there were two available weekends left for the Colorado Convention Center &#8211; two in all of 2017. The end of August and the middle of December. To organize an event of this size on what would be considered relatively short notice for a city as popular as Denver was essentially a fool&#8217;s errand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Nashville organizing team was able to secure its venue for early December dates, but a wider range of acceptable dates might be one way for WordCamp Central to improve the process for next year. This would give more cities the opportunity to submit competitive applications, as venues that can accommodate the expected size of WCUS are in high demand in popular cities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We had a great set of communities apply so it was tough to pick just one,&#8221; WordCamp Central representative Cami Kaos said. &#8220;In the end we went with Nashville for WordCamp US 2017-2018 because it seems like a great location for attendees, they had a beautiful venue that could accommodate an event of this size as we grow, and the dynamics between both teams were a natural fit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about Nashville, the organizing team has created a <a href="http://wpnashville.com/wcus/" target="_blank">page</a> that includes some favorite local attractions and rankings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ranked within the top 10 on Cvent ’s list of Top 50 Meeting Destinations in the United States. (August 2015)</li>\n<li>Named #3 Best Convention City in the 10 Best USA Today Readers’ Choice Awards</li>\n<li>Ranked #1 Friendliest City in America by Travel and Leisure (April 2015)</li>\n<li>Listed in Collaborate Magazine’s list of the Top 12 Foodie Cities for Meetings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nashville is centrally located for a relatively short drive or flight from anywhere in the US and should have ample options for accommodation. The city won the bid to host the WordCamp out of six applicants and Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s announcement post indicates that there were multiple local communities capable of hosting the event in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Based on the other great applications we got I’m also excited about the pipeline of communities that could host it in future years as WordCamp US travels across the United States and gives us an opportunity to learn and love a new city, as we have with Philadelphia,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 21:50:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"HeroPress: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1490";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9579:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/111616-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: If we serve the people around what we\'re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop & change alongside the people we serve." /><p>My story starts in high school as a girl with a technical bent, in a small country town just as computers were becoming mainstream but well before they were in everyone’s home. (I was in high school when Apple came to school and showed off this new fangled thing they called a mouse…). We were taught BASIC and Pascal and I actually really enjoyed tinkering with programming, but no one thought to say, “Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…” I mean, I was a girl (and girls didn’t ‘DO’ computers), and no one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.</p>\n<p>The truth is I wasn’t particularly ambitious, I didn’t have any kind of clue what I wanted to be ‘when I grew up’ so I allowed myself to be gently steered by my parents into leaving school before the end of my final year when I was encouraged to apply for a job in a bank.</p>\n<p>I got the job and started in the MICR processing department, encoding cheques with magnetic text, and I finished as a teller 3 years later (and boy was I terrible at balancing the books at the end of the day &#8211; I was much better at chatting to the customers!).</p>\n<p>Financial independence was the only name of that game; for me there was very little else to recommend the job, so I saved all the money I could and took off from both the bank, and my homeland (New Zealand) in very short order as a young, naive 20 year old primed to spend the next 3 years exploring the world. And by the world, I mean the US and Europe…</p>\n<p>That first mouse had come out in 1983, WordPress was founded in 2003 and in those 20 years the world changed. While it was doing that I was at various times being a nanny, working in child care centres, working in customer support, temping, and generally &#8216;working to live&#8217; in whatever way felt right at the time. However, in 1999 I packed up my bags once again, moved from New Zealand to Australia and took a place at a performing arts school where I honed my singing and performance skills and volunteered my time to our music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And so my personal revolution began.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On what I think was the day after I graduated from that course I walked into a full time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code. It was part of my job to edit those HTML newsletters and send them out every week. I went from there to buying books about coding for the web, experimenting on my home built PC making web pages. I’m sure like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser… from there I was completely hooked.</p>\n<p>By 2004 I was working full time as a webmaster, by 2005 I was running a small business creating sites on the side of my ‘real job’ and by 2009 that small business became my full time job as I left employment to pursue my Masters Degree in Digital Communication. It was in that year I met WordPress when I moved my old Movable Type blog onto it and within a very short time I was using  WP as the CMS of choice for all my client work…</p>\n<p>Then in 2011 I stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. THAT was the thing that changed my world.</p>\n<p>I flew on a whim from Sydney to Melbourne to attend this crazy inexpensive conference I had found after a google search for ‘WordPress Conferences’. In doing so I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back to Sydney excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WP community.</p>\n<p>Building a community around WP got off to a slow start in Sydney, but from an inauspicious early WPSyd meetup in the function room of a pub (one we actually held in the dark due to a blackout) my connection and involvement took off. Before long I was helping organise that Sydney meetup and by the time I moved away from that great city it had branched into 2 meetups, and soon after, into 3. Furthermore at the end of that first year, at my second ever WordCamp, I put my hand up to help organise a WordCamp Sydney in 2012 and then as I moved interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n<p>Here’s the point.</p>\n<p>WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now…) the thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress and any other software package exists to serve people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.</p>\n<p>In organising meetups, WordCamps, and community events around WordPress,  I have found that at the end of the day it isn’t actually WordPress that matters… it’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves. Even as my career in WP has moved through coding, into team support, into project management, there too it has been the people and my connections to them in the community that have helped fuel that transition.</p>\n<p>I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself. In all of this I feel as though I’m living proof that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, I myself have been helped, resourced and connected into places I’d have never dreamed of all those years ago as a teenager playing with that first mouse… experimenting with that BASIC code.</p>\n<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger said “Help others and give something back. I guarantee you will discover that while public service improves the lives and the world around you, its greatest reward is the enrichment and new meaning it will bring your own life.” and I completely agree.</p>\n<p>Ricky Martin said “A hero is someone who is willing to help others in his or her best capacity.” Here are two very different people giving voice to exactly what I’ve found in working and serving in this great community of diverse people. This is the kind of heroism I see around WordPress, at meetups and WordCamps; it’s the kind of hero whom I want to raise up, and at the end of the day, this is the kind of hero I hope that I am.</p>\n<p>Best of all, it’s the kind of hero that absolutely ANY of us can be.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life." class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Actually%2C%20WordPress%20didn%E2%80%99t%20change%20my%20life.&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Factually-wordpress-didnt-change-life%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life." class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Factually-wordpress-didnt-change-life%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Factually-wordpress-didnt-change-life%2F&title=Actually%2C+WordPress+didn%E2%80%99t+change+my+life." rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life."></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/111616-150x150.jpg&description=Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life." rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life."></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/" title="Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life."></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/">Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 12:00:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Dee Teal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.7 Beta 4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4576";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-beta-4/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1990:"<p>WordPress 4.7 Beta 4 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

After receiving a series of emails from the provider reminding him that payment was due, the provider terminated his account seven days after the invoice was overdue.</p>\n<p>Lundekvam said ordinarily he would expect his sites and servers to go offline in response to an unpaid invoice but this particular provider, which he would not identify, simply terminated his account.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I contacted the provider in good faith, knowing that any decent provider has complete backups of everything they terminate for X time after they terminate it,&#8221; Lundekvam said. &#8220;Apparently, with this &#8216;crappy&#8217; company, terminated means literally terminated. All decent backup providers have backups of their backups, and any provider with such a setup knows very well that terminating the backups at the same time as you terminate the original files is a HUGE mistake, after all, you have those backups in place just in case something is terminated wrongly or the system corrupts something. We can simply conclude with the fact that this provider didn&#8217;t do backups of their users&#8217; data and therefore would never be able to recover anything they have lost.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although Lundekvam mentioned Amazon Glacier in a <a href="https://wptavern.com/upvato-backup-service-terminated-by-storage-provider-files-may-not-be-recoverable" target="_blank">previous interview</a> as an example of how cheap storage space is, he confirmed that Amazon was not the provider in question here. &#8220;Amazon was quickly ironed out in the launch phase due to the heavy adjustments it needed to make it work exactly the way we wanted it to,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Lundekvam said he sincerely believed this backup provider was reliable and was disappointed to find out otherwise after trusting users&#8217; data with the company. Despite the misfortune and embarrassment of the current situation, he is determined to relaunch Upvato with a new provider that offers redundant backups.</p>\n<h3>Upvato to Relaunch with Improved Version that Allows Users to Define Backup Destination</h3>\n<p>Lundekvam said the new version will be launched &#8220;as soon as possible.&#8221; His team is considering firing up the current (old) version and then migrating as originally planned instead of relaunching with the new version. The improvements include a better backup algorithm and new functionality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The very new version will allow the user to define their own destination / choice of backup location, whether that be on Upvato&#8217;s servers, their own FTP / SFTP server, Dropbox, Amazon, and other providers we&#8217;re looking into implementing,&#8221; Lundekvam said. &#8220;This would make Upvato function as a mere gateway that detects and keeps your backups in sync at your favorite destination, while at the same time presenting the same awesome visual experience on the website to display the sales ad associated with the item.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lundekvam remains committed to keeping the core service free indefinitely and may add commercial upgrades if costs exceed what he is able to contribute on his own.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As long as I am able to sustain Upvato on my own, then it will remain ad-free and completely free to use,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But of course there are plans to monetize the website if we at some point need help keeping the lights on. That might be ad-generated revenue, or a premium service for premium functionality.

The Cyprus-based theme company has <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/author/alexitsios/" target="_blank">16 themes on WordPress.org</a>. Wedding themes are a relatively small niche in the directory with fewer than 20 listings. This new arrival stands out from the pack with its bold colors and customizability.</p>\n<p>Many WordPress wedding themes in the official directory seem like a wedding site forced into a blog-oriented design, with lingering post meta in areas where it serves no purpose. This particular niche is where a focused, one-page design really shines. Wedding Bride features event-specific front page sections for the couple to share their story but also allows for (optional) extra pages and a blog.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/wedding-bride-screenshot.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/wedding-bride-screenshot.png?resize=880%2C660&ssl=1" alt="wedding-bride-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60380" /></a></p>\n<p>All of the theme&#8217;s options can be found in the Customizer where users can upload a header image, personalize the header overlay, and add various content sections &#8211; all of which are optional. It also includes an option to make the navigation menu sticky or have it scroll with the page (default).</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/wedding-bride-theme-1.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/wedding-bride-theme-1.png?resize=1025%2C405&ssl=1" alt="wedding-bride-theme" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63806" /></a></p>\n<p>Wedding Bride users can customize the background color and/or image. Unfortunately, the theme does not include a color picker to customize the pink accent color, but this can be changed with a little CSS. Blog pages include a sidebar and it supports four widget areas in the footer. The contact form section was created for use with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/" target="_blank">Contact Form 7</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.platotheme.com/wedding-version/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see the theme in action. <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/wedding-bride/" target="_blank">Wedding Bride</a> is Alex Itsios&#8217; 16th theme on WordPress.org and his first foray into the wedding niche.

Losing files is a <a href="https://forums.envato.com/t/half-of-my-items-removed/27143/3" target="_blank">common frustration among Envato users</a>, as the company cannot guarantee the ongoing availability of products due to situations like copyright complaints and technical issues.</p>\n<p>Upvato made it easy for users to automatically backup their purchases, cataloguing them with screenshots, descriptions, titles, and author information. The service offered unlimited backups and Lundekvam encouraged users to connect their Envato accounts to keep their files safe. A few weeks ago, Upvato users started to suspect that the service was shutting down.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyone using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Upvato?src=hash">#Upvato</a> for their themes etc from <a href="https://twitter.com/envato">@envato</a> &#8211; I think you have just been duped!</p>\n<p>&mdash; Andrew Wilkinson (@parysnet) <a href="https://twitter.com/parysnet/status/793135773998514176">October 31, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What happened to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/upvato?src=hash">#upvato</a>?

After experiencing problems with Upvato&#8217;s provider, he is not hopeful that he can recover the files.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our provider&#8217;s automated systems terminated everything related to Upvato,&#8221; Lundekvam said. &#8220;I am so frustrated and upset that you won&#8217;t believe it, but I am doing what I can do recover the files and or get a backup up and running. But it seems like the provider isn&#8217;t and wasn&#8217;t really a reliable backup provider at all, and as it is right now, it looks really dark for a possible chance to recover the files.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lundekvam would not specify who his provider was, but had referenced Amazon Glacier in a <a href="https://wptavern.com/new-upvato-service-offers-free-backups-for-envato-market-products" target="_blank">previous interview</a> as an example of cheap storage space at a mere $7/month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Such things shouldn&#8217;t happen with a backup provider like Upvato, and I am extremely surprised that it happened with our backup provider, causing it to affect Upvato,&#8221; he said. He also confirmed that he does not plan to shut the service down permanently.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I am unable to recover the backup and files, then no, I am not shutting down,&#8221; Lundekvam said.&#8221; I would, and have to, install Upvato with a new provider and start over. Please rest assured that Upvato is coming back up. Regarding the concerned users, I am deeply sorry for the downtime and, possibly, loss of Envato files. It hurts that it happened, as this is in no way how I want Upvato to be seen or represented.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lundekvam would not respond to subsequent inquiries. Upvato has had ample time to share this news via other outlets but the service did not have a Twitter account and its website has vanished, leaving users without any information. Lundekvam had said in previous interviews that he did not have plans to monetize Upvato in the immediate future. His motivation was to &#8220;make something cool and useful that people might want and need.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, since he treated Upvato as a side project and did not have further backups in place, an unexpected problem with his provider has wiped out the files users trusted with the service. In an ironic twist, the service has inadvertantly replicated the exact situation that users hoped to avoid with Envato. Lundekvam has not responded to further inquiries on the status of the recovery process, but we will update when any new information is available.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 21:01:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"Matt: Flying Lotus, Never Catch Me";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46928";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"https://ma.tt/2016/11/flying-lotus-never-catch-me/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:357:"<p></p>\n<p>Music videos are themselves an art form, and it&#8217;s always interesting to me how an artist chooses to transform the interpretation of their song with the video.

Compressing emoji is a small way to speed up a sizeable chunk of the web. A <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37374" target="_blank">ticket</a> was created on Trac four months ago, requesting cache headers for emoji files and compression. According to Gary Pendergast, the change is something that can be made outside of the WordPress core development cycle, so he closed the ticket and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/systems/2016/07/20/there-are-no-cache-instructions/" target="_blank">passed the suggestion on to the Systems team</a>. Cache headers were added by the team, but compression was not implemented in that update.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The current plan is to move everything to a new CDN,&#8221; Gary Pendergast reported after chatting with the Systems team. &#8220;The current CDN is a bit outdated &#8211; they don’t support HTTP/2, for example. They need to do some more testing, but it’s high on the todo list.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, users who want compressed emoji can use Uysal&#8217;s plugin. It compressed the files using <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo" target="_blank">SVGO</a>, an open source Node.js-based tool for optimizing SVG vector graphics files. The tool removes unnecessary things like metadata, comments, hidden elements, and default or non-optimal values from the SVG files without affecting their rendering. Another advantage is it doesn&#8217;t require an internet connection for those who are developing locally.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/compressed-emoji/" target="_blank">Compressed Emoji</a> is available in the WordPress plugin directory and is also open for contributions on <a href="https://github.com/mustafauysal/compressed-emoji" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 23:49:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.7 Beta 3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4566";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-beta-3/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3091:"<p>WordPress 4.7 Beta 3 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

Baio&#8217;s media and technology blog has been a continual source of original content about life on the internet and how it affects our culture. The migration includes 472 posts and 15,891 entries from his sideblog <a href="http://waxy.org/category/links/" target="_blank">Waxy Links</a>.</p>\n<p>Waxy.org played a small part in WordPress.org&#8217;s early history. In 2005 Baio broke the story about <a href="http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/" target="_blank">WordPress quietly hosting search engine spam articles</a> in order to help cover some of the site&#8217;s expenses. The exposure and subsequent removal of <a href="http://random.waxy.org/html/google_wordpress.html" target="_blank">the articles</a> temporarily decimated WordPress.org&#8217;s pagerank but Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="https://ma.tt/2005/04/a-response/" target="_blank">response</a> to the situation brought more transparency to how the open source project was being funded. Baio interviewed Mullenweg for the piece and considered it his first foray into serious journalism.</p>\n<p>In his post about the site&#8217;s redesign Baio concedes that blogs are &#8220;not really part of the cultural conversation anymore&#8221; but said he thinks there&#8217;s still potential in the medium.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There a few reasons why I’m sad about the decline of independent blogging, and why I think they’re still worth fighting for,&#8221; Baio said. &#8220;Ultimately, it comes down to two things: ownership and control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Baio explained why it&#8217;s important for him to control his own space on the web, as opposed to putting content at the mercy of third-party platforms whose futures are not guaranteed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Last week, Twitter announced they’re shutting down Vine. Twitter, itself, may be acquired and changed in some terrible way. It’s not hard to imagine a post-Verizon Yahoo selling off Tumblr. Medium keeps pivoting, trying to find a successful revenue model. There’s no guarantee any of these platforms will be around in their current state in a year, let alone ten years from now.</p>\n<p>Here, I control my words. Nobody can shut this site down, run annoying ads on it, or sell it to a phone company. Nobody can tell me what I can or can’t say, and I have complete control over the way it’s displayed. Nobody except me can change the URL structure, breaking 14 years of links to content on the web.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://waxy.org/" target="_blank">Waxy.org</a> is now responsive and uses a custom theme built using Automattic&#8217;s <a href="http://components.underscores.me/" target="_blank">Components starter-theme generator</a>. Baio will continue exploring odd corners of the internet on his blog and plans to share his thoughts about the challenges of navigating the ecosystem of independent publishers.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 23:45:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"WPTavern: bbPress 2.5.11 Adds WordPress 4.7 Compatibility";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63694";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"https://wptavern.com/bbpress-2-5-11-adds-wordpress-4-7-compatibility";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2494:"<p>The bbPress development team has <a href="https://bbpress.org/blog/2016/11/bbpress-2-5-11-maintenance-release/">released 2.5.11</a> to add support <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/07/changed-loading-order-for-current-user-in-4-7/">for a technical change</a> in WordPress 4.7. Users are highly encouraged to update to bbPress 2.5.11 <strong>before</strong> updating to WordPress 4.7.

In addition to patching the issue in <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7305">BuddyPress</a> and <a href="https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2309">bbPress</a>, a new <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23016">wp_roles_init filter</a> was added to WordPress that allows plugins to add custom roles when they&#8217;re initialized.</p>\n<p>The changes mentioned above are technical in nature so I asked John James Jacoby, lead developer of bbPress, what the update really means. &#8220;bbPress loads its roles on-the-fly, in a similar way to how post-types and taxonomies are registered,&#8221; Jacoby told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With locales and roles now having a reversed load order, bbPress needed some code changes to work for both WordPress 4.6 and 4.7 without causing any problems for third-party bbPress plugins and non-English installations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This particular improvement has personal historical meaning to Jacoby, &#8220;This change to WordPress core in 4.7 is a long time coming,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was the very first bug I ever reported in WordPress&#8217; IRC channel back in 2008, when I was working on a large multi-lingual multisite installation. It&#8217;s how I met Peter Westwood and Jen Mylo, and it was their kindness that made it clear that WordPress was the platform for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jacoby also notes that per-forum moderators, favorites, and subscriptions have been rewritten in bbPress 2.6. During testing, performance enhancements were discovered and submitted to WordPress core and have been implemented across the forums on WordPress.org. Work continues on bbPress 2.6 which is expected to ship in 2017.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 22:33:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 253 – BuddyPress 2.8, WordCamp US, and PressNomics 5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=63684&preview=true&preview_id=63684";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-253-buddypress-2-8-wordcamp-us-and-pressnomics-5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3135:"<p>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, <a href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I discuss the news of the week.

This will be the first time the event has been held outside of the United States, a change that makes it more accessible for contributors who are unable to obtain a visa to enter the U.S.</p>\n<p>Attaching the summit to WordCamp Europe was the next logical step, as the event brings together project contributors from around the world. Europe is one of the fastest growing regions for the WordPress community in terms of events, with a <a href="https://wptavern.com/europe-tops-wordcamp-growth-in-2015-with-70-increase-in-events" target="_blank">70% increase in WordCamps in 2015</a>. There were 20 WordCamps held in October and 50% of those were hosted in European cities.</p>\n<p>The past three community summits have been invitation-only in order to ensure those present were active contributors to WordPress and to enable a format that facilitates face-to-face discussions on key issues facing the project and the community. This inevitably leaves many valuable contributors on the outside. In an effort to mitigate the sense of exclusivity around the event, the WordPress Community Team is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/11/03/wordpress-community-summit-2017/" target="_blank">proposing a new selection process for 2017</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we have to limit our attendance to have productive, collaborative discussions at the Summit, then choosing the participants becomes a challenge if we don’t know what the teams are going to discuss ahead of time. Therefore, this year I suggest we try something new:</p>\n<p>Let’s ask teams to decide on the challenging, controversial, or sensitive issues they want to discuss at the summit before the summit is held. Then, once the teams know what they want to talk over in person, they can nominate and select the people needed to represent all points of view in each of those discussions. This way, the event stays small, hard topics get discussed, but the selection process is more transparent and functional.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Rocio Valdivia, who posted the proposal on behalf of the team, roughly outlined how the selection process would work. She suggested each make.wordpress.org project team would create and publish a list of topics/issues for discussion at the summit and submit them by December 20th. Teams would then select representatives to attend the summit. Two members of those selected would be assigned to help with the organization and logistics of the summit, including tasks such as finding sponsors, travel assistance, and communication.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The intention of this approach is to propose a more open and team-focus Community Summit with transparent participation from all active contributors and reps of each team,&#8221; Valdivia said. &#8220;This way we can hopefully anticipate barriers and cross-team difficulties that might come up, and avoid them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This approach is different from past events where attendees were not part of the organizational aspects but it gives contributors more ownership of the event and their teams&#8217; specific goals. Details and logistics would be worked out later in the year with the help of the WCEU organizers.</p>\n<p>The Community Team is asking for feedback on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/11/03/wordpress-community-summit-2017/" target="_blank">proposal</a> before implementing a plan of action for the new selection process. As the open source project has grown, WordPress has hundreds of contributors spread across its three dozen core <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/components/" target="_blank">components</a>. So far contributors have weighed in on the initial proposed number of team representatives and the deadline for preparing topics.</p>\n<p>There was also some concern in the Community Team&#8217;s meeting on Slack as to whether the new selection process will perpetuate the pattern of the same people being invited to the summit every time simply because they are most active in the project. Allowing teams to nominate their representatives based on the anticipated topics will make the selection process more focused on which contributors are best suited to work on pressing issues. Moving the location to Europe will also give regional contributors the opportunity to bring fresh ideas and perspectives, especially regarding the challenges of multilingual publishing with WordPress.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 06:48:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:103:"WPTavern: A New Way to Search, Preview, and Install Themes in the Customizer Removed From WordPress 4.7";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63634";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:112:"https://wptavern.com/a-new-way-to-search-preview-and-install-themes-in-the-customizer-removed-from-wordpress-4-7";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4376:"<p>Astute testers may have noticed a new feature in WordPress 4.7 beta 1 that enabled users to search, preview, and install themes from within the customizer.

Samuel Sidler, <span class="st">Apollo Team Lead at Automattic</span>, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37661#comment:124">responded to Halsey </a>supporting Hou-Sandí&#8217;s decision.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Making a decision to pull a highly visible feature is hard, but, as you know, it&#8217;s ultimately one that the release lead should make as it&#8217;s <em>their release</em> and they have the best overall view,&#8221; Sidler said.</p>\n<p>Weston Ruter, who also helps maintain the Customizer component, asked if the revert could be reversed if patches to outstanding issues were created.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No &#8211; if this were a matter of problems that have defined solutions already then the course of action would not have been a revert,&#8221; Hou-Sandí <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37661#comment:130">responded</a>. &#8220;I know that it would feel better to have something more than &#8216;my gut and the guts of others say no&#8217;, but if there was more definition to the problems then we may not have been in a position where reverting from this release was the only sane thing to do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37661">feature has been punted</a> and the milestone was changed from WordPress 4.7 to a Future Release.</p>\n<h2>A Window Into How WordPress Development Works</h2>\n<p>The quotes I published above are only part of the story.

Confession? It feels like it sometimes. In my mind’s eye I see a roomful of skittish WordPress marketers with dark-ringed eyes, disclosing the number of times they pretended to understand something technical when it made about as much sense to them as the moon landing. Frustrated they can’t code it themselves. Maybe it’s just me in that room.</p>\n<p>I am a words person – a creative, a copywriter, and a marketer. My heart beats faster over ancient English literature, clever mailers, alliteration, storytelling and subject lines, and the shapeshifting challenge of building an authentic brand in a world of smoke, mirrors, and shmoozing.</p>\n<p>Topher asked me to write my WordPress story and when I thought about what I’ve learnt over the past two years what came to mind was: <strong>uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away</strong>.</p>\n<p>Far from being something to categorically flee or avoid, discomfort is a signpost to watch out for – something to embrace and step bravely towards. Obviously there are exceptions – but in my experience discomfort often means lean in, listen closely, change something.</p>\n<p>I’ve chosen to share a few of the ways I’ve encountered uncomfortable in my WordPress journey so far, and why I’m grateful.</p>\n<h3>A bit of background</h3>\n<p>Perhaps we are all creatures of habit on some level, but I really am. For example, when backpacking with my best friend in 2008 from Istanbul down to Cairo – through Syria and Jordan, including places that are now literally non-existent – she and I noticed that if we found a good restaurant I’d suggest returning the following night while she always wanted to try new spots.</p>\n<p>When I find something I like, it makes perfect sense to me to stick with it, sometimes to a fault. Until fairly recently I would have described myself as someone who didn’t thrive on change. This partly explains why by the age of twenty nine my entire life had played out in one city.</p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_5951-min.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1470" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_5951-min-1024x768.jpg" alt="Marina as a child with mother" width="960" height="720" /></a>My beautiful mum, brother and I. My mum is a superhuman and I miss her daily.\n<p>Birth, preschool to postgraduate studies, the first nine years of my career, family, friends, life – all in one patch.</p>\n<p>I have been privileged to do some excellent travelling to amazing places – European beach holidays and ski trips (obviously I broke my arm), teaching English for four weeks in South Korea, a cruise in Alaska, a church trip to Singapore and Malaysia, Vancouver to visit family – but my sense of home and place was unwaveringly Cape Town.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of 2014 I decided to emigrate. The delay between the idea occurring to me and resigning was less than two weeks. With a British passport through my English mum and a mild obsession with all things British, London was it. It seemed wise to secure a job first but my gut said I should have faith and move regardless so I resigned from Yuppiechef.com <a href="https://www.yuppiechef.com/spatula/10-thoughts-about-community-management-and-social-media/">where I’d been for nearly five years</a>, sold my car, and booked a one way ticket.</p>\n<p>At this point, it would be fair to say WordPress was not even really on my radar. It powered Yuppiechef’s blog so I’d used it in that capacity and <a href="https://marinapape.com/">my own blog</a> was on WordPress.com – but it was pretty much just a thing to do with the internet that helped people publish stuff.</p>\n<p>A week before I set off I was having sushi with friends and got chatting to a mouthy American who worked for WooThemes. Hearing of my pending departure and getting a sense of my strengths and what I loved to do, he suggested I consider applying. Less than a week later I accepted an offer to join Woo’s then-tiny marketing team. I’m still amazed at the speed with which it all happened – and will be forever amused by Mark and Warren’s confidence in me as a total WordPress n0ob (maybe they didn’t realise!).</p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_8001-min.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1471" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_8001-min-1024x768.jpg" alt="I love MailChimp. Freddy lives on my desk beside some Woo stickers" width="960" height="720" /></a>I love MailChimp. Freddy lives on my desk beside some Woo stickers\n<p>And so my WordPress journey began in London on 1 July 2014, fresh off the boat and working remotely for the first time. I logged online from a coffee shop – specifically Timberyard, which has become a familiar friend – and dived headfirst into a world I hadn’t realised would be so technical. And digital. Marketing a digital product is a very different kettle of fish to kitchen products. And working remotely as an extrovert?</p>\n<p>In my first week I was sent to WordCamp Brighton where I innocently asked someone the difference between .org and WordPress.com. This was the first prickle of my first uncomfortable hurdle: being okay with not knowing everything.</p>\n<h3>It really is okay not to know everything.</h3>\n<p>It sounds stupid to even write that one needs to be okay with not knowing everything – of course one can’t, but at Yuppiechef.com I sure knew a lot more about a lot more. There, my lack of technical understanding wasn’t a thing, marketing was lauded, and our brand was at the forefront of what set us apart. <a href="http://ventureburn.com/2013/03/the-yuppiechef-cult-how-a-startup-sparked-a-religion/">People wrote about how the following for Yuppiechef was cult-like</a>, and I’d helped create that.</p>\n<p>Joining Woo I was a tiny fish all over again, and I was swimming in a world with languages I didn’t understand.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid. – unknown (but attributed to Einstein)</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was a little bit terrifying to be a marketer in this tech-celebratory world. And it took me a long time to accept I have something significant to offer at WooCommerce (and now Automattic) and feel confident enough to add my voice to conversations. Why? I guess I am proud. In the early days I was constantly tempted to pretend to know more than I do (for the record this is a bad idea) and developed a hefty dose of imposter syndrome, which worsened when Automattic acquired WooCommerce. I found myself wondering if they would have hired me.</p>\n<p>For a few months, the fear I felt kept me from bringing to the table the valuable things I did know.</p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_7373-min.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1472" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_7373-min-1024x768.jpg" alt="Standing by a concrete wall with a vast ocean scene behind." width="960" height="720" /></a>With my team in Cape Town earlier this year. Nicole, Aviva, me, Gareth and Kevin &lt;3.\n<p>It’s scary admitting a lack of understanding, it takes strong relationships with colleagues (which take time to build, especially remotely) to raise your hand and be vulnerable. But the problem is that not doing so ends up blocking and robbing the contribution you could make. It silences your voice. It is not possible to be a master of all trades: yes I need a working understanding of our products, but I don’t need to become a Javascript developer. One body, many parts, all valuable.</p>\n<p>This learning curve was uncomfortable for me. At various points I have wanted to bail, or take a year to learn how to code fulltime. But I am really glad I haven’t because marketing is vital and that is what I can do. And do very well (when I’m not looking over my shoulder).</p>\n<p>It’s okay to be an expert in what you love, not what other people love. It’s why we have teams. It’s what makes the world interesting.</p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3576-min.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1473" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3576-min-1024x768.jpg" alt="Classroom filled with people" width="960" height="720" /></a>The first WordPress London meetup I attended. It was pretty awesome.\n<h3>Remote relationships take longer to build but they sure run deep.</h3>\n<p>My degree was in Psychology and it remains an active interest. ENFJ is proudly in my Twitter bio, I love taking personality tests and calling out and connecting with the underbellies and depths of fellow human beings.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>My friends are my estate</strong>. Forgive me then the avarice to hoard them.&#8221; – Emily Dickinson</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you’re familiar with Gallups Strengthfinder, I’m a Relator to the bone. People often ask how I have the discipline to work from home but that’s pocket change compared to the relational challenge. Showing up to work and being productive hasn’t been the thing I’ve found difficult – it’s trying to build relationship digitally with people far away and in different timezones.</p>\n<p>Plus I find there is a certain type of rapport, creativity, and energy that is really hard to create remotely when it comes to brainstorming and collaborating. The buzz of having an idea and someone else adding to it IRL, growing it into something greater. This was not a comfortable thing, but again choosing to stay has proven invaluable.</p>\n<p><strong>Remote relationships take longer to build, but they sure run deep</strong>. The bonding that happens when you come together for meetups and WordCamps is extraordinary. I have grown to properly know and love my colleagues (not all 500+ Automatticians yet but certainly my immediate team) and a bunch of awesome WordPress people I’ve met.</p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_8319-min.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1474" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_8319-min-1024x768.jpg" alt="On-screen grid of faces in a google hangout" width="960" height="720" /></a>Well hello Woo people.

My heart sometimes feels like it is scattered in little bits: a fragment with Scotty and the Dekode crew in Norway, another few with Louise in Kwazulu Natal, Cobus and Dom in Cape Town and chunks with Nicole and Aviva stateside. It’s fragmenting, but what a privilege.</p>\n<p>To keep me grounded day to day, I’ve helped start and now am involved in running a non-profit coworking space, which has opened up a whole new web of relationships in London. If you’re ever in town, pop into <a href="http://www.arkcoworking.com/">ARK Coworking</a> for a pour over coffee.</p>\n<p>Working remotely is different. But it’s a pretty niche kind of special to have a web of people around the world that you would otherwise be totally unconnected to.</p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4183-min.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1475" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4183-min.jpg" alt="People standing astride bikes, flashing gang symbols." width="749" height="549" /></a>The Woo biker gang on a marketing meetup near Lake Michigan, 2015\n<p>Which brings me to another uncomfortable hurdle brought squarely to me by WordPress: the challenge of responding well to diversity and difference.</p>\n<h3>Thinking something for a long time doesn’t mean it’s true.</h3>\n<p>Part of <a href="https://automattic.com/creed/">Automattic’s creed</a> is to never stop learning. Being part of WordPress has brought me into close proximity with a more varied, vocal, challenging, and diverse group than I could have made up.</p>\n<p>The thing about being a human is you only ever get to be one of them. One in over seven billion. How much about other people and parts of the world you don’t live in do you know, really? How much do I? Being part of WordPress has opened my eyes to diversity in a way that is hard to describe. Emigrating helped too, but it is very possible to live in a bubble wherever you go.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right. – Thomas Paine</p></blockquote>\n<p>Just because something has always been a certain way, doesn’t make it right. Being part of WordPress, and Automattic, has helped me greatly in learning how to hold what I believe to be right and true gently, and have equal respect for other people’s right and true.</p>\n<p>I ran the WooCommerce London meetup for two years which brought me into contact with a very mixed group; I was part of Automattic’s diversity workshop at the GM which was educational to say the least; when my friend Rosie started a <a href="http://mouthywomen.work/">blog</a> to highlight out how mouthy women get told they’re too masculine, I got behind her heart and soul.</p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-03-at-13.21.46-min.png"><img class="wp-image-1476 size-full" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-03-at-13.21.46-min.png" alt="Stewart Ritchie sharing at the WooCommerce London meetup.

Photo: Gabor Javorsky.\n<p>The most poignant example of this for me was much closer to home. I wrote some copy a while ago as the backstory of Woo’s ninja mascot, Hiro and included in it a bunch of references to Japanese culture that, though well intentioned, turned out to be not okay. It had been up for ages before someone with a different enough perspective flagged it. Ouch.</p>\n<p>I went home after a long day of tears and much Slack messaging and confided in my Malaysian flatmate about it, half expecting him to comfort me and say the whole thing really wasn’t such a big deal and that it didn’t bother him. Instead his only comment was: “<em>That’s good. It will make your company better.</em>”</p>\n<p>We live, we learn. We wound, we grow.</p>\n<p>John Maeda, who recently joined Automattic as Head of Design and Inclusion, calls such oversights in our thinking ‘lacunae’. Being part of the worldwide community of WordPress has brought a number of my own lacunae into sharp focus. It’s also made me more able to exist peacefully alongside people whose views I don’t share. I’m a human, they’re a human. Two in seven billion.</p>\n<p>Now, the idea of stepping away and retreating to a more homogenous, same-y group of people who tend to agree with me is not just unattractive, it’s scary.</p>\n<p>WordPress helps me be open-minded and it’s vehicle for doing this is individuals who are willing to speak up. Let’s help each other, as kindly and graciously as we can.</p>\n<h3>Marketing a WordPress product is difficult.</h3>\n<p>I’ve found marketing WooCommerce challenging for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First there is the classic digital marketer’s problem of how to build relationship with customers you never get to meet. All we have are words online and if we’re lucky some rituals and routines we can inject life into (I wrote about this strategy <a href="https://woocommerce.com/2015/11/4-customer-rituals/">here</a>).</p>\n<p>Over the past two years there have been a number of times I have thrown my hands up in the air and wanted to market something that is just easier to sell (coffee, an awesome gadget, luxury jewelry).</p>\n<p>On top of that eCommerce is a competitive space and selling WordPress can be a little complex messaging-wise, especially for non-coders and those not familiar with WordPress:</p>\n<p><em>Friend: Do I even have WooCommerce yet?</em><br />\n<em> Me: Yes it’s there in your downloads folder.</em><br />\n<em> Friend: <span>&lt;silence&gt;</span>.</em></p>\n<p>Every time I see another seductive Squarespace ad or the daily Shopify case study lands in my inbox (<em>How person x built y and changed the destiny of the human race</em>) – part of me can only see how far we have to go.</p>\n<p>But, I am enjoying fighting the good fight to democratise eCommerce with WordPress. I believe in what we’re doing, and in open source, and even though our competitors have bigger marketing teams and 24/7 phone support I feel a fierce loyalty to Woo.</p>\n<p>I don’t believe marketing has the emphasis it deserves in the WordPress space, but it’s coming to the fore. Great products don’t market themselves. The weaker thing will win if that is what is in front of people. I’m excited to be in this space.</p>\n<h3>Saying less is more. Narrow focus is healthy.</h3>\n<p>As someone who loves to joke around, natter, and come up with ideas, something I have learnt the hard way is that volume of words and number of ideas is not no an indicator of the quality of your contribution.</p>\n<p>It feels nice to be busy, but what is the deliverable?</p>\n<p>Having another great idea is not always helpful. Sometimes what I need to do is shut up and work. The manager versus maker ratio tends to leave a lot of cooks in the kitchen. Ideas are a dime a dozen. Pushing a few strategic things over the line, with your eyes on a goal everyone has agreed on, now that’s a better way.</p>\n<p>Staying focused working remotely can be hard. Fortunately, we have a great system of setting OKRs that my team is particularly diligent at sticking to. There are so. Many. Conversations. Going on all of the time. Focus is a healthy and freeing thing.</p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4139-min.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1477" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4139-min-1024x768.jpg" alt="Marina and Louise, heads together, grinning" width="960" height="720" /></a>My Woo bestie, Louise. Here we are in San Francisco in 2014. I went back to South Africa for her wedding this year :).\n<h3>Inclusion is a very important thing.</h3>\n<p>A final thing I am learning through WordPress, and which has made my uncomfortable for sure, is the importance of inclusion. I touched on this a little already, but it’s something that I have now got my teeth into and am not going to let go of. Inclusion is a thing.</p>\n<p>Something that is great about WordPress is that intrinsically inclusive, it’s open to all.</p>\n<p>It isn’t only about big shiny success stories where people are making thousands of dollars. It’s people all over the world, fighting to make WordPress available in all languages; it’s faithful meetup organisers sharing knowledge with those who are just starting out; it’s the GPL; it’s having childcare at WordCamps; it’s using <em>y’all</em> or <em>folks</em> not <em>guys</em> to greet an audience.</p>\n<p>WordPress is not slick, sometimes things get a bit messy and there are heated discussions on forums and in backchannels. But WordPress is also a lot like how the world should be – democratic, going out of it’s way to make room and include, and with more than just the bottom line driving decisions.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>That’s it from me. I hope sharing just a few of the ways WordPress has made me uncomfortable– what I learnt, and why I am glad I didn’t just bail – will be encouraging.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you are facing some tough things related to work or beyond. Maybe someone has expressed an opinion or belief that has made you uncomfortable. I’d encourage you to pause and take some time to think over whatever it is before acting.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Uncomfortable often means there is something amazing to be learnt.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Let’s be brave, open, and keep on learning together through this wonderful thing called WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4832-min.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1478" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4832-min-1024x768.jpg" alt="Pin board with hundreds of photos all over it." width="960" height="720" /></a></p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Uncomfortable%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20mean%20walk%20away&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Funcomfortable-doesnt-mean-walk-away%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Funcomfortable-doesnt-mean-walk-away%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Funcomfortable-doesnt-mean-walk-away%2F&title=Uncomfortable+doesn%E2%80%99t+mean+walk+away" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/uncomfortable-doesnt-mean-walk-away/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/110916-150x150.jpg&description=Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/uncomfortable-doesnt-mean-walk-away/" title="Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/uncomfortable-doesnt-mean-walk-away/">Uncomfortable doesn’t mean walk away</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 09 Nov 2016 12:00:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Marina Pape";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.8 Development Kicks Off, 2016 Survey Now Open for Developers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63402";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-8-development-kicks-off-2016-survey-now-open-for-developers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3278:"<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/buddypress-logo-blue.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/buddypress-logo-blue.png?resize=839%2C398&ssl=1" alt="buddypress-logo-blue" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30655" /></a></p>\n<p>Development for BuddyPress 2.8 kicked off during <a href="https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2016/11/05/dev-chat-summary-for-november-2-2016/" target="_blank">last week&#8217;s meeting</a> and the target release date was set for January 25.

Abakumov wants to dive deeper into security and plans to perform a security audit of the plugin.</p>\n<p>The BuddyPress core team will shape development for 2017 based on feedback from this year&#8217;s <a href="https://buddypress.org/2016/11/2016-buddypress-survey-site-builders-developers/" target="_blank">survey</a>, which opened November 1. It includes 36 questions aimed at site builders and developers, as opposed to previous years where the survey was <a href="https://buddypress.org/2014/01/2014-buddypress-survey/" target="_blank">open to users and anyone connected with the software</a>.</p>\n<p>The project&#8217;s change of direction is evident in the questions this year, which are decidedly developer-focused. According to the BuddyPress core team, these questions were prepared for the project&#8217;s primary audience of site builders and developers, &#8220;an explicit recognition of what BuddyPress has become, and how people use it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to the usual demographical questions, respondents are asked about their PHP versions, site setups, and local development environments. A new question asks when developers test their sites and extensions against upcoming releases. The survey also asks which template files developers customize when creating themes (with no option to indicate that you&#8217;re not a theme developer). Participants are asked to weigh in on BuddyPress&#8217; problem areas and to give feedback on the most frequent feature requests they receive from community members and clients.</p>\n<p>In 2013 the survey received 178 responses, 338 responses in 2014, and 211 in 2015. Given that the target audience is much narrower in 2016, the number of participants may decline again. However, the core team hopes responses will be more concentrated with the kind of information they find useful. The <a href="https://buddypress.org/2016/11/2016-buddypress-survey-site-builders-developers/" target="_blank">survey</a> will be open through November 20, 2016 and results will be posted before the end of the year.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 08 Nov 2016 18:17:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"WPTavern: WordCamp US Live Stream Tickets Now Available";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63030";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-live-stream-tickets-now-available";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2838:"<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/wordcamp-us.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/wordcamp-us.png?resize=1025%2C490&ssl=1" alt="wordcamp-us" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59619" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org" target="_blank">WordCamp US</a> is less than a month away and attendees are finalizing their travel plans.

The team received 600 submissions (up from 231 last year) and accepted less than 10% of them, according to Block.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that WCUS last year really excited a lot of people, and they were interested in being a part of it,&#8221; Block said. &#8220;We also had quite a bit more time on the speaker applications, since in 2015 we planned the entire conference in just about three months.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One exciting change this year is that <a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/2016/11/02/wordcamp-us-live-stream/" target="_blank">live stream tickets</a> will be free for those who are not able to attend the event. There&#8217;s no limit on the number of people who can watch live.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We really felt like there shouldn’t be a barrier to entry in attending WCUS,&#8221; Block said. &#8220;It’s the community’s conference, and everyone should be able to &#8216;attend&#8217; no matter where they physically are. We have some incredible sponsors, and making the live stream free felt like the best move.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last year&#8217;s live stream tickets included swag from the event, and WCUS 2016 will have commemorative t-shirts for sale in the swag store. In addition to the live stream, all of the sessions will be recorded and uploaded to WordPress.tv.

This transparent and open process of updating the guidelines resulted in more than a dozen contributors submitting pull requests with improvements to the language and content. The <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/" target="_blank">revamped guidelines</a> have now replaced the previous ones with language and expectations that are clearer and easier to understand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition to rewriting the guidelines, we took the time to codify the expectations of developers and cost of not abiding by the guidelines, as well as a reminder that we do remove plugins for security issues,&#8221; plugin team member Mika Epstein said in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/11/01/revised-guidelines-are-live/" target="_blank">announcement</a>. &#8220;We are doing our best to be transparent of what we expect from you and, in return, what you can expect from us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After several incidents this year where unclear guidelines contributed to confusion on issues like <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-cracks-down-on-incentivized-reviews-despite-lack-of-official-guideline" target="_blank">incentivized reviews</a> and <a href="https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-plugin-directory-will-no-longer-accept-frameworks" target="_blank">developers submitting frameworks</a>, the plugin team made the jump to update the five-year-old document. Although there are not major changes, some of the guidelines were considerably expanded for clarity. This includes #9: &#8220;The plugin and its developers must not do anything illegal, dishonest, or morally offensive.&#8221; The list was updated with several more examples of infractions that would land under this category.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a massive undertaking to re-write guidelines in the public eye in a way that won’t pull the rug out from anyone,&#8221; Epstein said. &#8220;Our goal was to clarify, not totally change, but also to address the needs of an ever changing technology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because the plugin directory was created to serve the WordPress project and its users, it doesn&#8217;t function like many other popular directories and marketplaces. Clear language and expectations are important, especially with WordPress&#8217; growing international user base. The newly updated guidelines should cut down on incidents where the plugin team has to enforce guidelines that were not explicitly documented.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 07 Nov 2016 06:03:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 2.7.2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"https://buddypress.org/?p=260750";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"https://buddypress.org/2016/11/buddypress-2-7-2/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:888:"<p>BuddyPress 2.7.2 is now available.

Luke Cavanagh <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35395#comment:83">has inquired</a> on whether an option will be added in the future to enable global CSS changes which could come in handy for making tweaks for active plugins.</p>\n<p>During testing, I didn&#8217;t encounter any issues with writing or pasting CSS code into the Additional CSS area.

To do that, I discovered the power of self-reflection and began a journey to understand the very core of who I am. I’m not a hero, but I know when to be one. When fear and worry appears I recognize it. And then I conquer it.</p>\n<p>If you don’t think you are good enough or smart enough to be and have what you want in life, then fear is holding you back, too. The story that follows is both inspired by and written for you.</p>\n<p>You may not believe it yet, but you’ve already got what it takes within yourself to live a happier life.</p>\n<p>Let me show you how you can discover it.</p>\n<h3>This Is Me Today.</h3>\n<p>I am a Norwegian expat in Canada. Here, I live in the heart of the world’s most multicultural city, Toronto, and lead a happy and full life with my wife and our furkid. By so many standards around our globe, my lifestyle is privileged. It hasn’t come easy, and I often am reminded of how fortunate I am.</p>\n<p>I never could have envisioned living this life when I, one and a half decades ago, trapped, lost and without hope and goals for the future, decided on a whim to learn how to code and develop websites. I read about people making a living out of it, yet didn’t believe it was something I myself could do.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After a year of trying, failing and learning I began to prove myself wrong.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Today I work at XWP, a global company powered remotely by people working from their homes around the world. Our core expertise is WordPress. Our team dreams up and engineers platforms, tools and workflows that let companies more effortlessly connect with their audience. We help our clients to sell and deliver their services and product, and grow communities that serves as an extension of their businesses.</p>\n<p>XWP’s roots date back to 2004, and I’ve been part of the journey for 10 of those years. In my current role I serve a team of 40 people. I was fully entrusted with the care of the company and the people working there by its owner in 2014. I am responsible for guiding our company vision, strategy and direction while ensuring its healthy growth and great performance. A vital area of my mandate is helping each person on our team have meaningful, impactful work in a purpose filled role they can be successful in.</p>\n<p>The workplace environment and my role allows me to connect directly with my own professional purpose &#8211; to be a catalyst and energizer in helping people discover their personal and professional strengths, and uncover the opportunities and possibilities it can bring in their life. At work, I am also able to apply my strength of bringing people together to build unity and community.</p>\n<p>At home, I am at my happiest when spending time with my wife and our senior rescue lab. The love I give and receive, our deep and our silly conversations together, and all the laughs we share are things that fills me up and re-energizes me. Cooking and serving food, especially for a small crowd, also energizes me. I’m known for preparing elaborate meals with menus that can take days to plan to get “just right”. Earlier this year I completed a Culinary Arts program at George Brown College here in Toronto to further explore my passion for food and for service.</p>\n<p>My whole life I’ve found joy in doing sports. In my youth I actively played football/soccer and volleyball and did well with it. Since moving to Toronto I’ve taken up running, and I’ve discovered a way to keep myself motivated to exercise and train is to sign up for running races. It also has become a way I get to compete against myself, measuring my improvement to pace and finishing times. In 2015 I ran my first half-marathon. My goal was to run a full marathon this year, but I pushed myself too hard and strained a muscle, so I’ll run it next year instead. I am looking forward to passing that 42.2km mark in under 4 hours.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I lead my life guided by a set of deeply held values, principles and beliefs:</li>\n<li>I value compassion, kindness, care, integrity and authenticity.</li>\n<li>I believe in serving others before myself.</li>\n<li>I offer my trust from the very start of a relationship, choosing to believe everyone has good intent in their heart.</li>\n<li>I strive to listen to and understand others. This lets me be empathic which will help me serve others needs better.</li>\n<li>I am of the opinion that everyone deserves to live a happy, fulfilling life, regardless of any personal flaw.</li>\n<li>I recognize my flaws and build up my strengths around them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am so grateful to have discovered all of this about myself at an early stage in life so I can live authentically who I am today and embrace all the opportunities it is affording me.</p>\n<h3>When I Discovered My Strengths.</h3>\n<p>I was invited to join the team at XHTMLized (today known as XFive, and a sister company of XWP), as a front-end developer in 2006. There was no shortage of work, the demand for its PSD-to-HTML service was growing rapidly. Opportunities to be part of great projects with exciting brands kept coming my way, and I continued to hone and develop my skills as a developer and project lead. Opportunities to be part of building the company surfaced, and I began investing time into helping the business grow.</p>\n<p>Trying on and wearing the hats of different areas of the business was encouraged. I served in a variety of roles that touched on most every function of the business, including project management, sales and account management, finance and HR. I would often run into new and unfamiliar territory. Through my own determination I battled my fear of failure, and figured out how to do the things that needed to be done. I was surrounded by people who believed in me and recognized my strengths and achievements even when I wasn’t able to see them myself.</p>\n<p>It was here that my belief in trust, empowerment, collaboration and autonomy in the workplace was shaped because I was experiencing how powerful it was first hand.</p>\n<p>When our WordPress-focused team came together to form XWP in 2014, the opportunity to lead the company surfaced.</p>\n<p>While faced with startup jitters and challenges of building up a brand new business, and while working with a team of enormous potential, I became uncertain of my own place in it. I questioned my ability to add value, to set us up in a way that would help us fulfill our potential. I began questioning my professional future. To deal with this uncertainty, I chose to start working with a professional coach. It was a decision that would greatly alter how I viewed myself and where I was in my career.</p>\n<p>Through the work with my coach, I was introduced to the concept of <em>unique ability</em>, a belief that at the heart of who you are lies the secret to your greatest success, best quality of life, and biggest contribution to the world. It gave me new hope. I began the work to define my own unique ability. I discovered the concept of <em>Servant Leadership</em>, the understanding that leadership is not for personal power or gain but it is in service to others. This deeply resonated with me. I had seen traits of Servant Leadership in people I worked with and I was unknowingly applying aspects of it in my own life.</p>\n<p>Within 6 months of coaching I had made the decision to pursue the role I have in the company today. I was believing in myself again and recognized that I could continue to make meaningful contribution and impact at the workplace I already had.</p>\n<p>I am reminded of a quote that has served me well over the last decade of my life and often comes to mind at times when I forget my strengths:</p>\n<p>“You must do the thing you think you cannot do”. &#8211; Eleanor Roosevelt</p>\n<h3>A Personal Sidestory.</h3>\n<p>My biggest personal transformation to date began when I found myself at rock bottom.</p>\n<p>I was at a complete and utter dead end in most areas of my life when I chose to end a personal relationship that had kept me abroad in the U.S for 12 years. I had come to the realization that in order to have the positive change I needed for myself, I had to be the change. I found the courage within to take the action needed to close an unfulfilling and unhappy chapter of life.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To do that, I needed to break with almost everything around me and start fresh &#8211; and it was <em>terrifying.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>And exhilarating. But mostly, it was just terrifying. I had to let go of people I had grown close to and become dependent on. I didn’t have money in my own pocket nor did I have a home of my own to go back to in Oslo. I put my pride aside and asked for help from my family and the company I was working for so I could do what I needed to do for myself. I renewed an expired passport. I booked a plane ticket. I made sure I met all requirements necessary to bring my little dog with me. I began shipping the few belongings I had back to Norway. And I prepared my closest friends and extended family there for my departure by asking for their support and understanding of my decision. It was one small step at the time, and each step helped move me forward.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Letting go of what I had then was one of the best decision I have ever made for myself. I gave myself permission to create a better life for myself.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A constant during this challenging period of my life was my remote work. It offered the flexibility I needed to relocate and start my next chapter.</p>\n<p>Back in Oslo, I settled into an apartment which my sister helped me find while I still was overseas and had been unable to travel. I took a few weeks off work, still conflicted with what I wanted out of life and worried about what the future would hold for me. During my leave of absence from work I was called upon to lead an onsite kick-off of a significant multisite WordPress migration project with an important client in Canada. In my mind, I was still in need of “me-time” to get my life in order. But I chose to embrace the opportunity to be there for our team and to serve our client together. It would be another life-changing decision. During my visit to Toronto, I met and fell in love with the person who would become my significant other.</p>\n<h3>Steps To Conquer Your Own Obstacles.</h3>\n<h4>Step 1: Commit To Becoming a Better You</h4>\n<p>I’ve learned through my personal and work experiences that nothing holds you back in life more than yourself. Life has taught me that who you aspire to be and what you want to do is within your reach. It’s within you.</p>\n<p>You can start a transformation that lets you move towards a happier, more fulfilling place by making a commitment to consciously and continuously learn and grow yourself.</p>\n<p>Welcome failures because they will provide you with new learning. You have the ability to overcome them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Take care to hone skills you have acquired. Develop new skills you aspire to have.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Discover your strengths. Apply them and find ways to develop them further. Your strengths makes up your unique ability, and your unique ability is who you are and why you are here. Use it, it will be your biggest contribution to the world.</p>\n<p>Be your own hero and get out of your own way. When you do, new and often unexpected opportunities are revealed. And you’ll discover that your possibilities in life are limitless.</p>\n<h4>Step 2: Find an Encourager</h4>\n<p>When you are ready to start your own journey of transformation, or if you are in the middle of one now, it’s important to find someone who can be your encourager and your ally on that journey.</p>\n<p>Look for someone in your circle of family or friends, or within the community. If don’t have anyone, I would welcome the opportunity to get to know you and cheer you on!</p>\n<h4>Step 3: Let Yourself Be Inspired.</h4>\n<p>Below are the key resources that helped spark my transformation in significant ways, and has lead me to where I am today. They continue to be sources of inspiration, and I hope they can be yours, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Books</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://strengths.gallup.com/110242/about-book.aspx">Strengths Based Leadership: Great Leaders, Teams, and Why People Follow</a><br />\n(Tom Rath)</li>\n<li><a href="http://uniqueability.com/">Unique Ability: Creating the Life You Want</a><br />\n(Dan O&#8217;Sullivan, Catherine Nomura, Shannon Waller &amp; Julia Waller)</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wireddifferently.coop">Wired Differently<br />\n</a>(Vern Dosch, Wally Goulet &amp; Tracy Finneman)</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.amy-wallace.com/creativity-inc/">Creativity Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration</a><br />\n(Ed Catmull &amp; Amy Wallace)</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/good-to-great.html">Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap&#8230;And Others Don&#8217;t</a><br />\n(Jim Collins)</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.danpontefract.com/the-second-book/">The Purpose Effect: Building Meaning in Yourself, Your Role and Your Organization</a><br />\n(Dan Pontefract)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Thought Leaders, Influencers &amp; Contributors to the Servant Leadership Community</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cheryl Bachelder &#8211; follow <a href="https://twitter.com/CABachelder">@CABachelder</a> (Popeyes)</li>\n<li>Art Barter &#8211; follow <a href="https://twitter.com/Art_Barter">@Art_Barter</a> (Servant leadership Institute)</li>\n<li>Ken Blanchard &#8211; follow <a href="https://twitter.com/kenblanchard">@kenblanchard</a> (The Ken Blanchard Companies)</li>\n<li>Garry Ridge &#8211; follow <a href="https://twitter.com/LearningMoment">@LearningMoment</a> (WD-40)</li>\n<li>Kevin Monroe &#8211; follow <a href="https://twitter.com/kevin_monroe">@kevin_monroe</a> (X Factor Consulting)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Giving Thanks.</h3>\n<p>I’d like to thank Topher DeRosia here at HeroPress for giving me the opportunity to share my story. It is against my nature to talk about myself to this extent, but I do it knowing it can serve others. To write my story, I’ve also had to move past my fear of being in the spotlight and accept there may be judgement passed. The reality is that no one will ever hold me to a higher standard or judge me harder than I do myself.</p>\n<p>A very special thanks goes out to my wife, Heather, who bore with me through the, at times, difficult writing process. She has opened my eyes to life’s possibilities. In her, I found a partner I wanted to journey with. She believes in me and helps me believe in myself, and she is my greatest ally and encourager. As I write these words, I recognize they will be published the week of our 4-year wedding anniversary. Our years together have been the very best of my life so far.</p>\n<p>I also want to offer a heartfelt thank you to another big ally and encourager, my coach and friend Jeff. He’s made me believe in pink fluffy unicorns dancing on rainbows, and I am so grateful for him coming into my life and having him be part of the journey.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I’d like to express my deepest gratitude to Dave and to the team at XWP. They have had and continue to have enormous impact on my life, and they hold a very special place in my heart. I look forward to continuing my journey with them.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Conquering%20My%20Obstacles%20To%20Happiness&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fconquering-obstacles-happiness%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fconquering-obstacles-happiness%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fconquering-obstacles-happiness%2F&title=Conquering+My+Obstacles+To+Happiness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/conquering-obstacles-happiness/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/110216-min-150x150.jpg&description=Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/conquering-obstacles-happiness/" title="Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/conquering-obstacles-happiness/">Conquering My Obstacles To Happiness</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 02 Nov 2016 11:00:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Tine Haugen";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"WPTavern: NaNoWriMo 2016 Kicks Off Today: Write Your Novel with WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63374";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"https://wptavern.com/nanowrimo-2016-kicks-off-today-write-your-novel-with-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6194:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nanowrimo.jpg?ssl=1"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nanowrimo.jpg?resize=1025%2C402&ssl=1" alt="nanowrimo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63376" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">NaNoWriMo</a> (National Novel Writing Month) today kicks off its 18th year helping writers achieve their creative goals. The online event is organized by a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that encourages participants to work towards writing a 50,000-word novel. Writers commit to posting their word counts to their profiles each day during the event, which runs from November 1-30.</p>\n<p>NaNoWriMo began in 1999 in the San Francisco Bay Area with just 21 writers and grew to 5,000 participants the following year, thanks to promotion from bloggers around the web. In 2015, the project had 431,626 participants, including 80,137 students and educators in the Young Writers Program.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Tools for NaNoWriMo</h3>\n<p>The NaNoWriMo website encourages writers to use their own materials for writing their novels, such as a word-processing program, typewriter, pen and paper, or whatever inspires the most creativity. WordPress is ideally suited for capturing your writing and keeping track of your word count. There are also several plugins that make it easy to break novels up into chapters and export your work into the proper formats for <a href="https://wptavern.com/how-to-self-publish-a-book-with-wordpress" target="_blank">self publishing with WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/nano-stats/" target="_blank">Nano Status</a> is a plugin created specifically for NaNoWriMo participants. Public accountability with word counts is one of the motivating factors for many writers who participate in the event, and Nano Stats makes it easy to display your progress in posts, pages, and sidebar widgets. It pulls in word count stats from the NaNoWriMo website for the username entered in the plugin&#8217;s settings.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nano-stats.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nano-stats.png?resize=616%2C359&ssl=1" alt="nano-stats" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63393" /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mybookprogress/" target="_blank">MyBookProgress</a> plugin is another option for tracking your novel&#8217;s progress and displaying stats. The plugin&#8217;s writing goals and deadline tracking features are customizable so it can also be used for other projects besides NaNoWriMo.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mybookprogress-widget.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mybookprogress-widget.png?resize=283%2C156&ssl=1" alt="mybookprogress-widget" class="alignright size-full wp-image-63396" /></a>MyBookProgress allows users to upload cover images for their books and displays a progress bar using a widget or a shortcode. It also includes MailChimp integration so that readers can subscribe to get progress updates on a book.</p>\n<p>In addition to the customizable goal tracking, MyBookProgress comes with preset template for NaNoWriMo participants who are working to achieve the 50,000-word goal. Progress can be recorded directly inside WordPress for display on your own website, as opposed to having to sign into the NaNoWriMo website. The backend of the plugin includes a writing statistics dashboard to give you an idea of which day of the week is your most productive, and your average percentage per day/week/month. Users can easily share their progress to Facebook or Twitter directly from the plugin&#8217;s writing dashboard.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MyBookProgress.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MyBookProgress.png?resize=805%2C582&ssl=1" alt="mybookprogress" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63398" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/author-wordcount/" target="_blank">Author Wordcount</a> is a much simpler plugin that allows writers to display one or multiple works in progress via a widget. Current word count and expected (goal) word count can be entered in the admin on the plugin&#8217;s settings page. It also has a simple UI that fits in more seamlessly with WordPress than the MyBookProgress plugin.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/author-wordcount.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/author-wordcount.png?resize=932%2C1198&ssl=1" alt="author-wordcount" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63404" /></a></p>\n<p>During the NaNoWriMo event&#8217;s 18-year history, nearly <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/published-wrimos" target="_blank">400 novels have been published</a> via traditional publishing houses. Participants have also self-published more than 200 novels. If you achieve your goal of finishing a novel and want to look into <a href="https://wptavern.com/how-to-self-publish-a-book-with-wordpress" target="_blank">self-publishing</a>, there are many tools that make it easy to export content hosted on both WordPress.com and self-hosted sites.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/anthologize/" target="_blank">Anthologize</a> plugin allows authors to publish their works in several ebook formats, including PDF, EPUB and TEI. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/bookpress-client/" target="_blank">BookPress Client</a> is another free plugin  that organizes your writing into a custom post type so book posts won’t show up mixed with normal blog posts on your site. It supports both ePub and Kindle mobi formats. WordPress.com users can take advantage of services like <a href="http://www.fastpencil.com/" target="_blank">FastPencil</a> or <a href="http://blog2print.sharedbook.com/blogworld/printmyblog/index.html" target="_blank">Blog2Print</a> for importing their posts into different book reader and print formats.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 01 Nov 2016 21:03:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"Mark Jaquith: The 4 best WordPress hosts of 2016";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/?p=5235";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"https://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/best-wordpress-hosts-in-2016/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6421:"<p>As a seasoned WordPress developer, I am frequently asked what WordPress web hosts I recommend. There are so many solid choices now! The WordPress ecosystem is truly a bounty of choice in 2016. I could write an exhaustive comparison of all of the options, but these are called &#8220;exhaustive comparisons&#8221; for a reason. Let&#8217;s skip that, and I&#8217;ll just tell you the four WordPress hosts I recommend in five&nbsp;distinct tiers.</p>\n<p>Note that many of these hosts target a range of sites, from starter sites to enterprise sites, so I am picking the hosts that I think fit each tier of site&nbsp;<em>best</em>, even though they might also work for other kinds of sites.</p>\n<h2>Starter Site</h2>\n<p><a href="https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm?afcode=d3f3dc4c98ccbebf43909e7d7971eca7&campaign=WordPress">SiteGround</a> is one of my favorite WordPress hosting companies. They offer a range of hosting solutions, but their WordPress-tailored plans are a tremendously good value and have many WordPress-specific perks. Ask around the WordPress community — SiteGround&nbsp;is a well-respected company that works hard to win and retain the business of WordPress customers. Their plans start as low as $3.95 a month, which is an incredibly good deal. If you aren&#8217;t sure what you need, SiteGround is what I would choose.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm?afcode=d3f3dc4c98ccbebf43909e7d7971eca7&campaign=WordPress">Take a look at SiteGround&#8217;s WordPress hosting plans</a>.</p>\n<h2>Developer-Friendly Site</h2>\n<p>What if you know your way around WordPress, want things like Git and <a href="https://wp-cli.org/">WP-CLI </a>access, or want advanced WordPress-friendly caching for your site? <a href="https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm?afcode=d3f3dc4c98ccbebf43909e7d7971eca7&campaign=WordPress">SiteGround has you covered</a> there, too. Their GoGeek plan (currently $14.95 a month) offers all of these perks, unlimited sites, WordPress staging sites, and so much more. I love working with GoGeek-level SiteGround sites, because they work really well and give me access to all the tools that I need as a developer. Or, if you&#8217;re not a developer, but have hired one to work on your site, you may want to upgrade to GoGeek hosting so she can work at maximum efficiency.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm?afcode=d3f3dc4c98ccbebf43909e7d7971eca7&campaign=WordPress">Go sign up for SiteGround&#8217;s GoGeek WordPress hosting</a>.</p>\n<h2>Intermediate&nbsp;Site</h2>\n<p><a href="http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=917225&u=1391570&m=41388&urllink=&afftrack=">WP Engine</a>&nbsp;has been around since 2010, focuses entirely on WordPress hosting, and has established themself as a solid choice in the intermediate range. Their plans start at $29/month and include a 60-day money-back guarantee and free automated migration of your existing WordPress site. WP Engine&nbsp;also has more advanced hosting options, so they&#8217;re an option that could grow with you.</p>\n<p><a href="http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=917225&u=1391570&m=41388&urllink=&afftrack=">Sign up for WP Engine using this link</a> and you&#8217;ll save 20% off your first payment.</p>\n<h2>Professional Site</h2>\n<p><a href="https://pantheon.io/pricing">Pantheon</a> got their start as a Drupal host, but have taken their innovative container-based hosting technology to the WordPress market. As a developer, I appreciate their Git-based development flow, their powerful &#8220;Terminus&#8221; command line client, and their built-in and dead-simple dev/test/live environments. On the higher level plans, you get &#8220;Multidev&#8221; which lets you spin up a sandboxed development environment for a specific Git branch. This means you can send clients and testers URLs for testing new features in isolation, before they are merged back into the main code branch. Awesome.</p>\n<p>Their professional tier starts at $100/month, which isn&#8217;t cheap, but your developers will love their deployment tools, their dev/test/live code staging flows, and their Git-based deploys to the development environment. Pantheon is a great choice for professional WordPress sites that have a developer on staff or on retainer.</p>\n<p><a href="https://pantheon.io/pricing">Check out Pantheon&#8217;s professional WordPress hosting plans</a>.</p>\n<h2>Enterprise Site</h2>\n<p><a href="http://pagely.7eer.net/c/335029/141222/2787">Pagely</a> has been around since 2006! They started the whole WordPress-dedicated hosting marketplace. When they started, they targeted a range of WordPress sites, but now they focus on enterprise hosting. This is where big brands go for custom WordPress hosting solutions. The folks at Pagely know WordPress well, and will be an excellent hosting partner for your enterprise WordPress site. Their VPS solutions start at $499/month, but they also have a shared server plan called Neutrino for $99/month.</p>\n<p><a href="http://pagely.7eer.net/c/335029/141222/2787">Get started with Pagely enterprise hosting</a>.</p>\n<h2>How I Picked</h2>\n<p>My method here was simple. I thought about how I answer if a friend or a client asks me for hosting advice. I found that I regarded sites as fitting in one of five categories. Then, I considered which hosts offer the best service and value in those categories, and picked these four hosts. After I had made my picks and written about their benefits, I went to see which of my picks had affiliate programs. Three of them did, and one did not. I used affiliate links for those that offered them, and a direct link for the one that did not.

The document offers a list of steps that includes, checking your computer for malware, changing passwords, and increasing the security of your Skype account.</p>\n<h2>Tips to Strengthen the Security of Your Skype Account</h2>\n<p>Microsoft recently made changes so that Skype, Office, Xbox, and other Microsoft services can be managed with a single account. If you haven&#8217;t <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/one-account-for-skype-and-your-other-microsoft-services">upgraded your Skype account</a> to a Microsoft account, visit <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/">Microsoft&#8217;s account</a> page and enter your Skype username and password. You&#8217;ll be prompted to upgrade which can only be done once.</p>\n<p>Once upgraded, click on the Security and Privacy settings link. This is where you can change your password, add security information, and enable two-step verification.</p>\n<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TwoStepAuthentication.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-63384" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TwoStepAuthentication.png?resize=445%2C171&ssl=1" alt="Two Factor Authentication Enabled" /></a>Two-Step Verification Enabled\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that in recent years, there have been major data leaks where the login credentials of millions of people have been exposed to the public. If you use the same password on multiple sites, visit <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a> and check to see if your password was leaked. If you see the Oh no — pwned! message, you should update your password immediately.</p>\n<h3>Create a New Primary Alias</h3>\n<p>In addition to changing passwords and turning on two-step verification, you should limit the aliases that are allowed to login to your account. By default, your Skype username is the primary alias. You should change this to an email address or a phone number and disable your Skype username. Allowing only one alias that&#8217;s different from your Skype username limits the amount of entry points into your account.</p>\n<h2>Keeping Tabs On Your Skype Account</h2>\n<p>One of the major benefits of upgrading a Skype account to a Microsoft account is the ability to view recent activity. To view the most recent activity, click the Security and Privacy link and click on the <strong>see my recent activity</strong> link.</p>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SeeRecentActivity.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-63387" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SeeRecentActivity.png?resize=1025%2C395&ssl=1" alt="How to View Recent Activity" /></a>How to View Recent Activity\n<p>This will inform you of successful and unsuccessful login attempts.

He identified <a href="https://github.com/wix/WordPress-Editor-Android" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://github.com/wix/react-native-wordpress-editor" target="_blank">repositories</a> that Wix forked in order to bring the GPL-licensed WordPress Rich Text Editor into its app.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I were being charitable, I’d say, &#8216;The app’s editor is based on the WordPress mobile app’s editor.&#8217; Mullenweg said. &#8220;If I were being honest, I’d say that Wix copied WordPress without attribution, credit, or following the license.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even though the Wix app is made up of different modules and libraries, the GPL requires that the entire application be GPL-licensed since Wix is distributing the app with GPL code in it. Open sourcing the entire app&#8217;s code under the GPL is the only way to resolve the license violation, according to Mullenweg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Your app’s editor is built with stolen code, so your whole app is now in violation of the license,&#8221; Mullenweg said. Some took issue with use of the term &#8220;stolen code&#8221; in connection with public, open source repositories, but the effect is the same regardless of Wix&#8217;s intention. Wix distributed GPL code without respecting its license, putting new limitations on it instead of preserving its freedoms. That code was not legally available to be repurposed without following its license.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You’d probably be in the clear if you had used just the original editor we started with (ZSSRichTextEditor, MIT licensed),&#8221; Automattic&#8217;s General Counsel Paul Sieminski commented on the issue. &#8220;Instead, Wix took our version of the editor which has 1000+ original commits on top of the original MIT editor, that took more than a year to write. We improved it. A lot. And Wix took those improvements, used them in their app but then stripped out all of the important rights that they’re not legally allowed to take away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg called for Wix to release its entire mobile app under the GPL, as required by the license, and make the source code available so that others can build on it and learn from it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you want to close the door on innovation, Wix, that’s your decision to make — just write your own code,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;If you’re going to join the open source community, play by the open source rules.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Wix CEO Responds, Neglects to Address GPL Licensing Issues</h3>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s open letter to Wix took the company by surprise. Wix CEO Avishai Abrahami <a href="http://www.wix.com/blog/2016/10/dear-matt-mullenweg-an-open-letter-from-wix-coms-ceo-avishai-abrahami/" target="_blank">responded</a> the next day on the company&#8217;s blog with a tone that imposed an artificial sense of fraternity in order to make the original allegation appear to be an over reaction. &#8220;Wow, dude I did not even know we were fighting,&#8221; Abrahami said. He cited Wix&#8217;s manifold contributions to open source software on the company&#8217;s GitHub account and their admiration of WordPress&#8217; commitment to giving back.</p>\n<p>His artful deflection avoids the licensing issue completely and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the GPL:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes, we did use the WordPress open source library for a minor part of the application (that is the concept of open source right?), and everything we improved there or modified, we submitted back as open source, see here in this <a href="https://github.com/wix/react-native-wordpress-editor" target="_blank">link</a> – you should check it out, pretty cool way of using it on mobile native. I really think you guys can use it with your app (and it is open source, so you are welcome to use it for free). And, by the way, the part that we used was in fact developed by another and modified by you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>GPL compliance, however, requires more than a show of open source spirit. Abrahami did not address the requirement that the entire mobile app be released as GPL but offered a vague statement about sharing code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you need source code that we have, and we have not yet released, then, most likely we will be happy to share, you only need to ask,&#8221; Abrahami said. It is still unclear as to whether his statement means the company will release the entire mobile app under the GPL or not. However, the company indicated on Twitter that they will release the app on GitHub.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/yairwein">@yairwein</a> We\'ll release the code on Github, where we also shared our previous projects: <a href="https://t.co/FBhp2Kd5wn">https://t.co/FBhp2Kd5wn</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Wix.com (@Wix) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wix/status/792656290854174721">October 30, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The other option would be for the company to completely remove any GPL code from its app and use the original MIT-licensed library for the editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress GPL Rich Text component in question, is actually a wrapper around another Rich Text component named ZSSRichTextEditor which is licensed MIT,&#8221; Wix lead engineer Tal Kol said in the article he <a href="https://medium.com/@talkol/how-i-found-myself-accused-of-stealing-code-from-wordpress-a7350da9f9f2#.h5zgf9lnc" target="_blank">published</a> over the weekend. &#8220;In retrospect it would have been easier to use it directly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Using the original library would stop the current GPL infringement but does not erase the fact that the company has already violated the license by distributing the code.</p>\n<p>Wix has not yet officially announced what it plans to do, but at the time of publishing the company continues to distribute GPL code inside its proprietary app.</p>\n<h3>Mullenweg Is Willing to Go to Court to Protect the GPL</h3>\n<p>According to the GNU.org GPL FAQ, the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#WhoHasThePower" target="_blank">copyright holders of the software have the power to enforce the GPL</a>, as the license is a copyright license. Copyright holders are advised to inform developers of the GPL-covered software if they see a violation. With the GPLv2, the only way for license violators to receive back their rights after violation is to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html" target="_blank">petition the copyright holder</a>. Mullenweg has already identified a path to compliance for Wix.</p>\n<p>Although many in the open source community are itching for a definitive court case involving the GPL, Mullenweg said his preferred outcome is to see Wix open source its mobile app.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would much rather they just release their app as GPL rather than have to get into a legal fight,&#8221; he <a href="https://ma.tt/2016/10/wix-and-the-gpl/#comment-586279" target="_blank">replied</a> to commenters on his blog.</p>\n<p>When I asked if he is willing to take the matter to court if Wix does not comply, Mullenweg said, &#8220;We would of course go to court to protect the GPL.&#8221; He also said that if Wix decides to pursue the other avenue, &#8220;removing the library would fix it going forward, but not for things that already infringed.&#8221; Mullenweg could not say what Automattic will or won&#8217;t do in a legal context regarding the past infringement, as the situation is still developing.</p>\n<p>This weekend&#8217;s debate between Mullenweg and Wix sparked discussions across social media platforms as well as blog post responses about how the the GPL affects the industry. It also shows how divisive the license can be even among open source software proponents. Mullenweg, who is known inside the WordPress community as a zealous defender of the GPL, has demonstrated a willingness to go to battle over <a href="https://wptavern.com/mullenweg-and-pearson-square-off-on-patents-gpl-and-trademarks" target="_blank">violations of the license in the past</a>.</p>\n<p>Many in the WordPress and Wix communities took issue with the public handling of the matter, but ultimately the controversy is not a personal matter between Mullenweg and Wix. The proprietary mobile app distributes GPL code that was the work of many contributors. WordPress&#8217; open source code was built from the hard work of people who were willing to give that time and energy because they believe in the project and the freedoms that its license guarantees. Wix&#8217;s disrespect of that license illegally co-opts those contributions for the company&#8217;s closed source app.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;My program will have liberty, or never be born.&#8221;</h3>\n<p>The GPL license is holistic in the sense that all parts of an application are connected &#8211; if one part bears the freedoms of the GPL, the entire app benefits from the GPL and must be therefore be open for all. The GPL is the reason WordPress exists and the reason why Mullenweg is so passionate about it. If b2/cafelog had not been GPL-licensed, Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little would not have been able to <a href="https://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/" target="_blank">build on it</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the questions in the GNU GPL FAQ asks, &#8220;<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#WhatIfSchool" target="_blank">What if my school might want to make my program into its own proprietary software product?</a>&#8221; This question addresses how many universities try to restrict the use of the knowledge and information they (and their students) develop, a problem that also exists in commercial businesses. The GNU recommendation for developers wanting to ensure their software is allowed to be GPL licensed is to raise the issue at the earliest possible stage for the most leverage:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So we recommend that you approach them when the program is only half-done, saying, &#8216;If you will agree to releasing this as free software, I will finish it.&#8217; Don&#8217;t think of this as a bluff. To prevail, you must have the courage to say, <strong>&#8216;My program will have liberty, or never be born.&#8217;</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This powerful sentiment is one that many GPL software contributors have adopted as a way of life. They contribute code on the basis that it will be passed on with all its freedoms. Taking GPL-licensed code and putting it in a proprietary app is an affront to their contributions.</p>\n<p>Wix CEO Avishai Abrahami&#8217;s casual response identifies both parties as open source proponents who are working to make the web a better place. This response misses the mark because it fails to recognize WordPress&#8217; 13-year history with the GPL and how deeply it has impacted the software&#8217;s trajectory and ability to make the web a better, more open place. This license and WordPress&#8217; commitment to user freedoms has been the project&#8217;s true north from its inception.</p>\n<p>When a project is given the GPL license, it makes that code and the license&#8217;s freedoms inseparable. Essentially, that code isn&#8217;t legally available to anyone without those freedoms in place. Regardless of whether Wix&#8217;s deflection of the issue is motivated by ignorance of the GPL or malicious intent, the company has to answer for its misuse of the software. The ball is now in Wix&#8217;s court &#8211; to comply with what the GPL license requires or take its own interpretation to court.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 21:23:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Matt: Apples TV’s Struggles";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46916";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"https://ma.tt/2016/10/apples-tvs-struggles/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:983:"<p><a href="http://joe-steel.com/2016-10-28-Apples-October-TV-Surprise.html"><img class="  wp-image-46924 alignright" src="https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2016/10/apple-tv.jpg?resize=231%2C201&ssl=1" alt="apple-tv.jpg" /></a>Joseph Rosensteel has <a href="http://joe-steel.com/2016-10-28-Apples-October-TV-Surprise.html">an outsider but savvy perspective on the updates and technology around Apple TV</a>.

Last week I downloaded the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wixcom-launches-wix-app-providing-a-powerful-mobile-operating-system-for-small-business-owners-store-owners-hoteliers-and-bloggers-around-the-world-300339448.html">new Wix (closed, proprietary, non-open-sourced, non-GPL) mobile app</a>. I’m always interested to see how others tackle the challenge of building and editing websites from a mobile device.</p>\n<p>I started playing around with the editor, and felt… déjà vu. It was familiar. Like I had used it before.</p>\n<p>Turns out I had. Because it’s WordPress.</p>\n<p>If I were being charitable, I’d say, &#8220;The app&#8217;s editor is based on the WordPress mobile app&#8217;s editor.&#8221; If I were being honest, I&#8217;d say that Wix copied WordPress without attribution, credit, or following the license. The custom icons, the class names, even the bugs. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/wix/WordPress-Editor-Android">forked</a><a href="https://github.com/wix/react-native-wordpress-editor"> repositories</a> on GitHub complete with original commits from Alex and Maxime, two developers on Automattic’s mobile team. Wix has always borrowed liberally from WordPress &#8212; including their company name, which used to be Wixpress Ltd. &#8212; but this blatant rip-off and code theft is beyond anything I&#8217;ve seen before from a competitor.</p>\n<h3>Dear Wix,</h3>\n<p>This explicitly contravenes the GPL, which requires attribution and a corresponding GPL license on whatever you release publicly built on top of GPL code. The GPL is what has allowed WordPress to flourish, and that let us create this code. Your app&#8217;s editor is built with stolen code, so your whole app is now in violation of the license.</p>\n<p>I suppose we’ll take this as a compliment &#8212; I’m sure the hundreds of people who have contributed to WordPress Core and our mobile apps are flattered that you chose to build one of your company’s core features using our code. We’re also excited to see what great things you create with all the time you saved not having to write your own mobile editor.</p>\n<p>You know what’d be even more exciting? To see you abide by the GPL and release your source code back to the community that gave you that jump start.</p>\n<p>I’ve always said that <a href="https://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/">the GPL isn’t about limits, it’s about possibilities</a>. In open source software, you trade some of your control as a developer to better serve the developer community and the people using your sites and products. I don’t think that’s a limit, I think it’s a way to make sure we encourage innovation and momentum. If you want to close the door on innovation, Wix, that’s your decision to make &#8212; just write your own code. If you’re going to join the open source community, play by the open source rules.</p>\n<p>Release your app under the GPL, and put the source code for your app up on GitHub so that we can all build on it, improve it, and learn from it.</p>\n<p>Love,<br />\nMatt and the open source community</p>\n<h3>An Update</h3>\n<p>The <a href="http://www.wix.com/blog/2016/10/dear-matt-mullenweg-an-open-letter-from-wix-coms-ceo-avishai-abrahami/">CEO of Wix has posted a response on their blog</a>. I&#8217;ll also try to post my response it to the comments there. <a href="http://wpgarage.com/news-views/weak-wix-response-wordpress-gpl/">Miriam Schwab also has a very good response</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were all very surprised by your post, as you have so many claims against us.</p>\n<p>Wow, dude I did not even know we were fighting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a fight: the claim is that the Wix mobile apps distribute GPL code and aren&#8217;t themselves GPL, so they violate the license.</p>\n<blockquote><p>First, you say we have been taking from the open source community without giving back, well, of course, that isn’t true. Here is a list of 224 projects on our public <a href="https://github.com/wix" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>, and as you can see they are all dated before your post. We have not checked if WordPress is using them, but you are more than welcome to do so, some of them are pretty good.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Very glad your company has projects on GitHub! Thank you for the offer to use them; if we do, we&#8217;ll make sure to follow the license you&#8217;ve put on the code very carefully.</p>\n<p>Releasing other open source projects doesn&#8217;t mean that you can violate the license of the editor code you distributed in your mobile apps. To repeat my earlier points: since you distributed GPL code with your apps, the entire apps need to be released at GPL, not just your modifications to that one library.</p>\n<p>As <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12828814">this Hacker News comment put it</a>, &#8220;Open source is not a swap meet; you can&#8217;t violate a license if you voluntarily release some other code to make up for it.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>We always shared and admired your commitment to give back, which is exactly why we have those 224 open source projects, and thousands more bugs/improvements available to the open source community and we will release the app you saw as well.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you were to release the entire source code of the apps under GPL that would bring you back into compliance with the license you violated. I <em>think</em> you&#8217;re saying you will do that here, but can you clarify? When should we look for the app code to be released, and where? That would resolve this issue completely.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Next, you talk about the Wix App being stolen from WordPress. There are more than 3 million lines of code in the Wix application, notably the hotels/blogs/chat/eCommerce/scheduling/booking is all our code.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I said the app includes stolen code. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s 30 lines or 30 million lines: because it includes GPL code and you distributed the app, the entire thing needs to be GPL. If you release the entire app&#8217;s code, as I think you said you would, then that resolves the license violation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes, we did use the WordPress open source library for a minor part of the application (that is the concept of open source right?), and everything we improved there or modified, we submitted back as open source, see here in this <a href="https://github.com/wix/react-native-wordpress-editor" target="_blank">link</a> – you should check it out, pretty cool way of using it on mobile native. I really think you guys can use it with your app (and it is open source, so you are welcome to use it for free). And, by the way, the part that we used was in fact developed by another and modified by you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thank you for admitting you used the code and not trying to hide it. The issue isn&#8217;t the changes you made, it&#8217;s that including the editor means you need to submit the entire app as open source, which you have not yet &#8212; it&#8217;s completely proprietary.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you want to read the account from Tal Kol, one of the leading engineers on this project, <a href="https://medium.com/@talkol/how-i-found-myself-accused-of-stealing-code-from-wordpress-a7350da9f9f2#.7yyylkagl" target="_blank">here it is</a>. He was really happy to share his side of the story.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I have seen it, and it <a href="https://medium.com/@csu/can-you-address-this-point-made-in-matts-post-this-explicitly-contravenes-the-gpl-which-7b6460b5b3e1">already has a number of good comments on it, including this one</a>: &#8220;Can you address this point made in Matt’s post: &#8216;This explicitly contravenes the GPL, which requires attribution and a corresponding GPL license on whatever you release publicly built on top of GPL code&#8217;.&#8221; It appears you and Tal might share a misunderstanding of how the GPL works &#8212; software licensing can be tricky and many people make honest mistakes. (If you want to get into serious detail, <a href="https://ma.tt/2016/10/wix-and-the-gpl/#comment-586319">this comment</a> lays the licensing requirements out clearly.) It is easy to rectify this one: release your apps as open source under the GPL.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Now, what is this thing about us stealing your branding? Our product was always called Wix and our website Wix.com, we never borrowed from your marketing or brand.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sorry for including this distraction; I was referring specifically to the fact that Wix used to go by &#8220;Wixpress.&#8221; You can see this <a href="http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-29IDMU/0x0xS1193125-13-387285/1576789/filing.pdf">in your Form F-1</a>, and there used to be a support page about this on your site:</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46910" src="https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-30-at-3.12.19-AM.png?resize=604%2C94&ssl=1" alt="" /></p>\n<p>Although that is still in Google, the <a href="https://www.wix.com/support/html5/ugc/62ae9410-79d0-4198-8ff1-4a37966e1e94/0d1a19e1-c862-44e4-a9d6-bc813f8a9207">page</a> it links to <a href="https://cloudup.com/cu5miENIoLl">now mysteriously returns a 404 error</a>, which you may want to look into.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In fact, if I remember correctly, until recently the Automattic home page was all about blogs and only recently it has become “websites.” Also, your business model changed to almost exactly the one we had for years. Can it be that you guys are borrowing from us? If so, again, you are welcome to it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic home page</a> has been a series of haiku about our products <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121218130226/http://wordpress.com/">since 2009</a>, pretty much unchanged &#8212; I think you mean the WordPress.com home page here. WordPress has been used for creating websites, not just blogs, since <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/">our 1.5 release in 2005 added themes and pages</a>. In my <a href="https://ma.tt/2014/10/sotw-2014/">2014 State of the Word address</a> I talked about how 87% of WordPress sites use it as a CMS. We regularly test dozens of variations of the WP.com homepage and some of them definitely emphasize website creation. I will say we look to Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace as innovators in the space with products that reach many small businesses, and Wix especially should be commended for its success and growth as a public company.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you believe that we need to give you credit, that you deserve credit, I must say, absolutely yes. You guys deserve a lot of credit, but not because of a few lines of source code, you deserve credit because you guys have been making the internet dramatically better, and for that we at Wix are big fans. We love what you have been trying to do, and are working very hard to add our own contribution to make the internet better.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thank you very much, that is kind. I do think there are a lot of values we share in common and would love to see this one issue resolved.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you need source code that we have, and we have not yet released, then, most likely we will be happy to share, you only need to ask. We share your belief that making the internet better, is best for everyone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s what my post was asking, for you to release the code. To quote my original letter: &#8220;Release your app under the GPL, and put the source code for your app up on GitHub so that we can all build on it, improve it, and learn from it.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Finally, during the last couple of years, I reached out a couple of times trying to meet with you. Could I do that again here? I believe in friendly competition, and as much fun as it is to chat over the blogosphere, maybe we can also do it over a cup of coffee?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once this is resolved I&#8217;d be happy to meet up. I believe when we exchanged emails in 2014 there was trouble finding overlap in our travel schedules.</p>\n<p>I hope the above clarifies where we think Wix made a mistake, and how to fix it.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 19:45:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Matt: Kanye McDonald’s Poem";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46881";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"https://ma.tt/2016/10/kanye-mcdonalds-poem/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:302:"<p>You might need a reason to smile today.

The headers drop-down menu is now in the top row of buttons while the strikethrough and horizontal rule buttons are on the second row.</p>\n<p>The underline and justify buttons are no longer available. According to Andrew Ozz, who primarily works on the TinyMCE editor in WordPress, underlining text causes confusion as readers may interpret it as a link.

Core contributors are asking for testing and feedback on some of the larger items ahead of the official release, slated for <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/4-7/" target="_blank">December 6</a>.</p>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen and its support for atmospheric videos is one of the major front-facing features in 4.7 that could use testing. Last week, when <a href="https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-default-theme-twenty-seventeen-merged-into-4-7" target="_blank">Twenty Seventeen was merged</a>, there was some uncertainty as to whether or not the first version would ship with video headers. Contributors knuckled down and worked quickly to get basic <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38172" target="_blank">core support for video headers</a> ready for an initial commit.</p>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen will be the first WordPress theme to use the new feature. Users will be able to manage video headers in the customizer by selecting a video via the media library or setting a URL to an external video, such as one hosted on YouTube. Theme authors who want to add support for videos will be able to do so by passing &#8216;video&#8217; => true as an argument when adding theme support for custom headers. If the browser is unable to play the video, it will fallback to the header image.</p>\n<p>Other user-facing features that require testing include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New site setup flow</li>\n<li>Custom CSS with live previews</li>\n<li>User admin languages</li>\n<li>PDF thumbnail previews</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 release lead Helen Hou-Sandí also requested that plugin and theme developers test the REST API content endpoints, any plugins that might be impacted by the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/08/wp_hook-next-generation-actions-and-filters/" target="_blank">WP_Hook overhaul</a>, the expanded Settings Registration API, custom bulk actions, post type templates, and a few other items.</p>\n<p>With the impressive list of features on deck for 4.7, it&#8217;s only fitting that Beta 1 was accompanied by an extended five-stanza haiku.

For years developers have coveted that same functionality for other post types. In fact, a plugin that attempted to create this functionality (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-template/" target="_blank">Custom Post Template</a>), has more than 50,000 active installs, despite not having been updated for four years.</p>\n<p>Post type templates follow a format similar to that of the existing custom page templates. The author can specify a template name as well as the post types where the template will be available as a dropdown in the page attributes metabox. The current implementation of post type templates can be used with any post type without having to register support for page-attributes. The metabox will be displayed if at least one template exists for a post type.</p>\n<p><code>/*<br />\n * Template Name: Foggy Memories<br />\n * Template Post Type: memory, event<br />\n */</code></p>\n<p>The <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18375" target="_blank">ticket</a> for the feature, which was opened four years ago, includes many potential use cases. One developer was building a project involving landing pages that were set up as custom post types. He needed to have multiple templates for the landing pages but had to create a work around since post type templates were not yet available.</p>\n<p>Another developer wanted to make a distinction between posts with guest contributors versus those coming from regular writers, such as displaying author boxes and avatars. Since this project was for a client, an implementation involving post templates would make it easy to assign the different designs via the dropdown in the post attributes metabox.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By opening up the page template functionality to all post types, we continue to improve the template hierarchy&#8217;s flexibility,&#8221; WordPress core committer Pascal Birchler said in his commit message. This new feature opens up many new avenues of customization for theme developers who want to offer alternative layouts and designs for posts. It also makes it easy to include multiple designs (inside a theme) for specific custom post types that a theme will support.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 04:35:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.7 Beta 1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4535";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/10/wordpress-4-7-beta-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6878:"<p>WordPress 4.7 Beta 1 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.7, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.7-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 is slated for release on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/4-7/">December 6</a>, but we need your help to get there. We&#8217;ve been working on a lot of things, many of them to make getting your site set up the way you want it much easier. Here are some of the bigger items to test and help us find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://2017.wordpress.net/"><strong>Twenty Seventeen</strong></a> &#8211; A brand new default theme brings your site to life with immersive featured images, video headers, and subtle animations. With a focus on business sites, it features multiple sections on the front page as well as widgets, navigation and social menus, a logo, and more. Personalize its asymmetrical grid with a custom color scheme and showcase your multimedia content with post formats. Our default theme for 2017 works great in many languages, for any abilities, and on any device.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Headers</strong> &#8211; Sometimes a big atmospheric video as a moving header image is just what you need to showcase your wares; go ahead and try it out with Twenty Seventeen. Need some video inspiration? Try searching for sites with video headers available for download and use.</li>\n<li><strong>Set up your site in one flow</strong> &#8211; From finding and installing themes right inside the customizer, to automatically staged theme-specific starter content, to clickable shortcuts that jump directly to editing an item from the preview pane, to adding pages while you&#8217;re building a nav menu or setting a static front page: getting a new site spun up and ready to share with a friend or a coworker is faster and easier than it&#8217;s ever been. Note: starter content appears when live previewing brand new sites and is currently only available in Twenty Seventeen. We&#8217;ll be expanding this to other bundled themes very soon, and perhaps to sites with existing content in future releases of WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom CSS with live previews</strong> &#8211; Ever needed to hide or tweak the look of something in your theme or from a plugin? Now you can do it with CSS and live preview the results while customizing your site. CSS can be a powerful tool; you may find that you won&#8217;t need the theme editor or child themes anymore.</li>\n<li><strong>User admin languages</strong> &#8211; Just because your site is in one language doesn&#8217;t mean that everybody helping manage it prefers that language for their admin. To try this out, you&#8217;ll need to have more than one language installed, which will make a user language option available in your profile.</li>\n<li><strong>PDF thumbnail previews</strong> &#8211; Uploading PDFs will now generate thumbnail images so you can more easily distinguish between all your documents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, there have been exciting changes for developers to explore as well, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API content endpoints</strong> &#8211; If you only test one thing as a developer, please test these. This phase is particularly helpful for people building plugins, themes, and in-admin interfaces. Can you build the things you need? Are these ready for release, and is the world ready for them?

Just as JavaScript is a near necessity for smoother user experiences and more modern PHP versions are critical for performance, SSL just makes sense as the next hurdle our users are going to face.</p>\n<p>SSL basically means the link between your browser and the server is encrypted. SSL used to be difficult to implement, and often expensive or slow. Modern browsers, and the incredible success of projects like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> have made getting a certificate to secure your site fast, free, and something we think every host should support by default, especially in a post-Snowden era. Google also weighs <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html">SSL as a search engine ranking factor</a> and will begin <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-will-soon-shame-all-websites-that-are-unencrypted-chrome-https">flagging unencrypted sites in Chrome</a>.</p>\n<p>First, early in 2017, we will only promote hosting partners that provide a SSL certificate by default in their accounts. Later we will begin to assess which features, such as API authentication, would benefit the most from SSL and make them only enabled when SSL is there.</p>\n<p>Separately, I also think the performance improvements in PHP7 are particularly impressive, and major kudos to everyone who worked on that. We will consider whether hosts use PHP7 by default for new accounts next year as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"4588";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"WordPress 4.7 Release Candidate";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-release-candidate/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 04:26:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4579";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:328:"The release candidate for WordPress 4.7 is now available.

The REST API endpoints saw a number of bugfixes and notably now have anonymous comment off by default.</p>\n<p>Not sure where to start with testing?

We&#8217;ve been working on a lot of things, many of them to make getting your site set up the way you want it much easier. Here are some of the bigger items to test and help us find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://2017.wordpress.net/"><strong>Twenty Seventeen</strong></a> &#8211; A brand new default theme brings your site to life with immersive featured images, video headers, and subtle animations. With a focus on business sites, it features multiple sections on the front page as well as widgets, navigation and social menus, a logo, and more. Personalize its asymmetrical grid with a custom color scheme and showcase your multimedia content with post formats. Our default theme for 2017 works great in many languages, for any abilities, and on any device.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Headers</strong> &#8211; Sometimes a big atmospheric video as a moving header image is just what you need to showcase your wares; go ahead and try it out with Twenty Seventeen. Need some video inspiration? Try searching for sites with video headers available for download and use.</li>\n<li><strong>Set up your site in one flow</strong> &#8211; From finding and installing themes right inside the customizer, to automatically staged theme-specific starter content, to clickable shortcuts that jump directly to editing an item from the preview pane, to adding pages while you&#8217;re building a nav menu or setting a static front page: getting a new site spun up and ready to share with a friend or a coworker is faster and easier than it&#8217;s ever been. Note: starter content appears when live previewing brand new sites and is currently only available in Twenty Seventeen. We&#8217;ll be expanding this to other bundled themes very soon, and perhaps to sites with existing content in future releases of WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom CSS with live previews</strong> &#8211; Ever needed to hide or tweak the look of something in your theme or from a plugin? Now you can do it with CSS and live preview the results while customizing your site. CSS can be a powerful tool; you may find that you won&#8217;t need the theme editor or child themes anymore.</li>\n<li><strong>User admin languages</strong> &#8211; Just because your site is in one language doesn&#8217;t mean that everybody helping manage it prefers that language for their admin. To try this out, you&#8217;ll need to have more than one language installed, which will make a user language option available in your profile.</li>\n<li><strong>PDF thumbnail previews</strong> &#8211; Uploading PDFs will now generate thumbnail images so you can more easily distinguish between all your documents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, there have been exciting changes for developers to explore as well, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API content endpoints</strong> &#8211; If you only test one thing as a developer, please test these. This phase is particularly helpful for people building plugins, themes, and in-admin interfaces. Can you build the things you need? Are these ready for release, and is the world ready for them?

The team chosen to host in 2018 will need to be planning throughout 2017 and should be present on the ground in Paris, so the selection process is already underway.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe is currently WordPress&#8217; largest community event, and support and mentorship have been a key part of its success. Petya Raykovska, a past organizer, said the prospect of organizing the event can be intimidating for new teams but mentors will be available to applicants throughout the process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The mentors are supposed to help the local teams prepare a better application,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;They are all experienced WCEU organizers who can help with many aspects of the planning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Host city selection is based on more than two dozen factors, including organizer experience, location, venue, and budget considerations. One of the most challenging aspects is securing a venue that can accommodate 3,000 attendees, but applicants are given a lot of flexibility on the event date.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We ask volunteers to book a venue for 3,000 people,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;Not only are there not many venues that can fit us at this scale, most of them are booked years in advance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Raykovska said organizers can book dates anywhere from May 1 &#8211; June 31, 2018. This makes it possible to have more cities and venues vying to host the event.</p>\n<p>Raykovska volunteered in Leiden in 2013 and helped organize WordCamp Sofia after that. In 2014, she applied to host WordCamp Europe in Sofia along with Tina Kesova, Nikolay Bachiyski, Veselin Nikolov, and Mario Peshev. Since that time she has been involved in organizing the event and mentoring newcomers. Potential applicants are encouraged to get in touch if they are wondering if their team has what it takes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes these conversations serve as a reality check,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;People can get super enthusiastic about organizing without having an idea of the time commitment. We want WCEU to be a positive experience for organizers and make sure our local teams have enough people and are aware what it takes to get involved as a local host.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2016/12/08/apply-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/" target="_blank">Applications for host city</a> will be open through February 15, 2017 and the decision will be made by the end of February. The team selected for 2018 will then join the 2017 planning team to gain a better understanding of the process. Potential applicants who want to be matched to a mentor can get in touch by emailing host at wp-europe.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In late 2013, one tweet pushed the WordCamp Sofia team to apply to host WCEU,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;It turned into the most incredible journey I&#8217;ve taken so far with stops further beyond the future host cities of Seville, Vienna, and Paris. It&#8217;s time for someone to write the next chapter of the story.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 Dec 2016 23:44:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"Post Status: Photos from Post Status Publish and WordCamp US 2016";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=31040";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"https://poststatus.com/photos-post-status-publish-wordcamp-us-2016/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55162:"<p>Last week was a whirlwind of events.

was WordCamp US. I unfortunately didn&#8217;t get to any sessions other than Matt&#8217;s State of the Word. But thankfully they&#8217;ll all be up on WordPress.tv, so I can catch up on the many that I wanted to attend.</p>\n<p>All photos directly before and during Matt&#8217;s <a href="https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-state-word-2016/">State of the Word</a> are by Brian Richards. I took most of the hallway shots.</p>\n\n<a href="https://poststatus.com/photos-post-status-publish-wordcamp-us-2016/wcus-2016-1/"><img width="150" height="100"

Day</h3>\n<p>Finally, Contributor Day was on Sunday. In addition to the contributor area itself, lunch was at the market where you can choose from a variety of lunch spots, with common cafeteria seating. I had an awesome spicy roast pork sandwich from Dinic&#8217;s, which I took a few pictures of as well.</p>\n\n<a

Founders Dan Norris and Alex McClafferty bootstrapped WP Curve in 2013 and have processed 105,000+ jobs through its pipeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Curve complements GoDaddy’s expanding WordPress offering including Managed WordPress and the recent ManageWP addition,&#8221; the company said in the announcement.</p>\n<p>Existing customers will be on-boarded to GoDaddy accounts with their current subscriptions. After the transition, the newly acquired WP Curve team will assist in scaling the services to support GoDaddy&#8217;s WordPress customers. Norris plans to exit the company and McClafferty will lead the team at GoDaddy.</p>\n<h3>GoDaddy&#8217;s Plans for WP Curve</h3>\n<p>Gabe Mays, head of WordPress Products at GoDaddy, said the WP Curve acquisition is an important part of GoDaddy&#8217;s goal to become &#8220;a one-stop shop for WordPress professionals.&#8221; Roughly one third of all GoDaddy sites are running on WordPress, and half of all new sites are using the software. This is one of the reasons GoDaddy plans to <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-passes-27-market-share-banks-on-customizer-for-continued-success" target="_blank">invest in improvements to WordPress&#8217; core customizer component</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Curve will help us in two ways,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;First we’re adding WP Curve’s WordPress experts to the company and we’ll leverage their expertise to improve the training and tools for the hundreds of GoDaddy Customer Care representatives that support our customers globally.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Second, we’ll directly offer WP Curve&#8217;s services to our customers,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;This combination will be amazing for our customers and create a compelling one-stop shop for WordPress professionals and their clients.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mays said WP Curve&#8217;s services &#8220;will continue to be offered as standalone services&#8221; but GoDaddy may consider adding them to its hosting plans sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Down the road it&#8217;s possible we&#8217;ll see aspects integrated into our Hosting plans to improve the customer experience, especially for nascent WordPress users,&#8221; Mays said.</p>\n<p>Mays would not comment on whether GoDaddy has more acquisitions in the pipeline, but the company is likely to require additional expertise if it aims to become a one-stop shop for WordPress professionals. GoDaddy is part of a more recent trend of hosting companies acquiring WordPress products and services, including its <a href="https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-wordpress-site-management-service-managewp" target="_blank">ManageWP acquisition</a> and <a href="https://wptavern.com/flywheel-acquires-wordpress-local-development-tool-pressmatic" target="_blank">Flywheel&#8217;s purchase of Pressmatic</a>. The trend has sparked some recent discussion on Twitter regarding &#8220;hosting companies eating WordPress:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If software is eating the world, then hosting companies are eating WordPress.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Cory Miller (@corymiller303) <a href="https://twitter.com/corymiller303/status/805891418866806784">December 5, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mays sees this notion as a positive development and an opportunity for hosts to become more deeply invested in WordPress core and the surrounding ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We see it as win-win for hosts and the WordPress community, more investment in WordPress is better for everyone,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;For example, this year we hired our first core contributor, contributed full translations to some of the most popular themes and plugins, built a number of themes and plugins and contributed them to the WordPress repo and more. As a WordPress community we need all the investment we can get to reach our 50% goal and beyond.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just days after the WP Curve acquisition, GoDaddy <a href="https://aboutus.godaddy.net/newsroom/news-releases/news-releases-details/2016/GoDaddy-Acquires-Host-Europe-Group-Becomes-Market-Leader-In-Europe-For-Small-Business-Cloud-Services/default.aspx" target="_blank">announced</a> its acquisition of <a href="https://www.heg.com/" target="_blank">Host Europe Group</a> (HEG) for $1.8 billion.

Sucuri is a website security platform that helps clean and protect websites. I would consider us a small mid-sized company. Our annual sponsorship budget is in the range of $300 &#8211; $400k per calendar year (CY).</p>\n<p>One of the industry events we’ve been actively participating in since our inception has been WordCamps. Unlike 2015, in 2016 I decided to be more pragmatic in the way we invest in WordCamps. This new approach stemmed from two basic questions &#8211; <b>What is the ROI of sponsoring a WordCamp and should a business sponsor a WordCamp?</b></p>\n<p>One qualifier I want to add before getting started is that tracking success at events is very difficult. Even with the number of tools and approaches in the market, many organizations struggle getting their hands around the actual ROI of any event sponsorship. This means that many of the points in this post are not unique to the WordPress ecosystem, but the uniqueness and openness of the community makes it worth discussing.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>The Reality of WordCamps and Sponsors</h1>\n<p>It’s been many years since I helped co-organize a WordCamp (<a href="https://2011.sandiego.wordcamp.org/">San Diego back in 2011</a>), and there is no denying that a lot has changed in the way they are put together. The one thing that hasn’t changed however, is the struggle organizers face when it comes to fundraising. Over the years we’ve seen a number of awesome initiatives by the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/">WordPress Foundation</a> to help assist in the process.</p>\n<p>At <a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp US 2016</a>, <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle">the State of Word reported </a>that in 2016 alone there were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>116 WordCamps around the world</li>\n<li>36,000 attendees</li>\n<li>2,056 speakers</li>\n<li>1,036 sponsors</li>\n<li>750 organizers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What makes it even more impressive is that these are events put on by volunteers. Matt Mullenweg also shared that these WordCamps are made possible by the generosity of the various sponsors which cover 85 &#8211; 95% of the costs associated with such events.</p>\n<p>It’s because of these sponsors that the costs are kept so low for attendees; including the annual event (WCUS) which came in at a cost greater than $500 per person but sold for ~$20 / day (Total of $40 / person). This is truly a herculean feat, and I commend them on their success to date.</p>\n<h1>The Sponsor Canoe Is Leaking</h1>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Canoes.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64321" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Canoes.png?resize=705%2C210&ssl=1" alt="Canoes" /></a>photo credit: dolbinator1000 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/126654539@N08/25305151246">Boyhood</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>With this in mind, I think it’s fair to say that at the rate things are going we might find ourselves with a problem of scale. While there have been 1k + sponsors in 2016, I would wager that a majority of the money is likely coming from a smaller subset of that group.</p>\n<p>Taking this into consideration, unless you’re Automattic, I can’t help but imagine that as a business the ROI question continues to come up as it does for me. This is further compounded by the dramatic increase in the <strong>a)</strong> request for sponsorships (# of camps) and <strong>b)</strong> the economics of the sponsorship itself (the $$ amount).</p>\n<p>This makes me think that it’s only a matter of time when the source of funds will be exhausted. Organizations have fiduciary responsibilities to their companies to spend their cash flow wisely, especially in today’s turbulent economic times.</p>\n<p>The impacts of this, as highlighted above, are going to be felt (if not already) by those volunteers trying to put on these great WordCamps. This will become exceptionally difficult for new camps, especially those in remote cities and countries.</p>\n<h1>Why Do Businesses Sponsor WordCamps?</h1>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QuestionmarkSmaller.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-48305" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QuestionmarkSmaller.png?resize=650%2C200&ssl=1" alt="Smaller Question mark featured image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/matthewmcvickar/4380126801/">Matthew McVickar</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>There is one common phrase every business that has invested in WordCamps has come to terms with &#8211; <b>sponsorships are done in-kind; expect nothing</b>.<i> I’m not clear how this guidance came to be, whether it was explicitly outlined by the Foundation or guidance that came to be over time. What I do know is that a good number of sponsors are familiar with it. </i></p>\n<p>Whether intended or not, allow me to be the first to publicly admit that while we are familiar with the phrase, no one really subscribes to it. The dirty little secret is that every business has some form of an expected ROI. It’s not always financially based, but there is some expectation. Companies sponsor events because there is some vested interest unless we’re talking about a child’s gymnastics or softball team.</p>\n<p>ROI takes many different shapes. Allow me to share the ROI as I see it when I look across the spectrum of some of today’s top sponsors (know that these are all my opinions as a third-party observer):</p>\n<h3><b>GoDaddy </b></h3>\n<p>They sponsor because they need to. When they came into the space two to three years ago, after the changing of the guard they identified the potential in WordPress. They had an image problem; one that couldn’t be fixed remotely. It had to be fixed with boots on the ground.</p>\n<p>Building relationships. Sharing experiences. Engaging influencers (do not underestimate the power of influencers). Whatever you might think of the brand today is nothing compared to what it was a few years ago. WordCamps have been a critical piece of their strategy to make this work. Who doesn’t know <a href="https://ifyouwillit.com/about-mendel-kurland/">Mendel Kurland</a>?</p>\n<h3><b>SiteGround </b></h3>\n<p>When they started to make their big push into the market, they were at every camp giving away free accounts. For them, it wasn’t about the short-term gain as much as the long-term gain. They had everything going against them. They were from Bulgaria working to service the biggest economic market, the US. They were trying to penetrate what many would argue was an already saturated market.</p>\n<p>I remember when they first appeared. No one knew them, and yet through their guerrilla marketing tactics, brand ambassadorship, stellar performance with customers, and word-of-mouth referrals, they are a powerhouse in the WP hosting space.</p>\n<h3><b>WP Engine</b></h3>\n<p>While they exploded through a number of initiatives, I believe that WordCamps and their strategy to engage with the community is what propelled them ahead of their competitors. Their focus wasn’t revenue generation early on. I recall their free accounts campaign. I think it ran for close to two years.</p>\n<p>What better combination than to have a freemium-like model where all you have to do is focus on user adoption (oversimplification of course). Your product and support are spot on, you just need more people touching it, more people telling their friends about it. They grew organically and these events made that possible.</p>\n<h3><b>Automattic</b></h3>\n<p>Honestly, they have no choice but to sponsor. They are the project sponsor by design. They are in many ways tied to the success and continued growth of the platform. They too have their free services that require adoption and user growth, things like Jetpack, Akismet, WooCommerce, and so many others.</p>\n<p>Without growth, they are dead solutions. They have to show support for a product that they’ve gone all in on. If they don’t sponsor, why would anyone else? Their fates are intertwined.</p>\n<p>And the observations go on. Granted, these are obvious gross oversimplifications, but I share them to highlight what ROI can look like. I also share them to show you what success looks like, and what the DNA of these organizations look like. Most of the scenarios above are built on the idea of “free” or “free-ish” services, with the exception being GoDaddy whose prices are so low you might as well consider them a freemium-like model.</p>\n<h1>Measuring the ROI of Events</h1>\n<p>What happens if you’re a premium service though? In this scenario, your ROI is no longer about adoption or user growth. Instead you’re now focused on growth in the form of revenue and sales. User adoption will never be as great as the freemium model.</p>\n<p>As organizations, we’ve invested a lot of money. There has to be something we’re getting out of this. Only in the WordCamp community have I seen this idea that people will donate not only time, but money, under the assumption that there will be nothing at the end of the tunnel.</p>\n<p>I wanted to better understand this myself, and what better place to look for ROI than our own data here at Sucuri.</p>\n<p>The data below highlights the period between December 2015 &#8211; June 2016. I encourage other businesses to share their own data to add to the conversation. When speaking to ROI, I looked for measurable attributes first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many marketing leads were captured?</li>\n<li>How many sales leads were captured?</li>\n<li>How many of those leads converted to sales?</li>\n<li>What kind of exposure did we get via social?</li>\n<li>What kind of exposure did we get via backlinks?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest immeasurable metric being:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What kind of brand awareness are you really getting?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the table below, <b>sponsorship</b> is exactly what you’d think, while <b>financial investment</b> implies ancillary costs of getting people there, lodging and eating. It does not include labor, collateral, shipping and other items.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucurisWordCampsInvestments.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64325" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucurisWordCampsInvestments.png?resize=996%2C265&ssl=1" alt="Sucuri WordCamp Investments Dec. 2015 - June 2016" /></a>Sucuri&#8217;s WordCamp Investments Dec. 2015 &#8211; June 2016\n<p>This chart shows the ROI we got in terms of money (did we close deals?) As a for-profit business one of the many attributes we look at are the total net-new customers we can generate from any investment, including events.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucuriCPLCACInvestment.png?ssl=1"><img class="wp-image-64327 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucuriCPLCACInvestment.png?resize=887%2C259&ssl=1" alt="Sucuri Investment CPL/CAC Analysis" /></a>Sucuri Investment CPL/CAC Analysis\n<p>To date, from all the events including WordCamp US (2015), we were able to track a total of 13 deals that closed from a direct engagement at the event. Putting the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) in the neighborhood of $12.4k per closed lead.</p>\n<p>This means that my lifetime value (LTV), if they purchased a basic plan at $199.99 would have to be 45 years. If they purchased our $499.99 plan, we&#8217;d be looking at a 18 year LTV.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucuriInvestmentMeasurableROI.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64328" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucuriInvestmentMeasurableROI.png?resize=1006%2C165&ssl=1" alt="Sucuri Investment Measurable ROI" /></a>Sucuri Investment Measurable ROI\n<p>Focusing on exposure, it is one of the many things you get from sponsoring an event. You get linkbacks from the event, shout outs on the pages, posts highlighting your sponsorship. What does that really amount to? Can it be measured? The easiest way to answer these questions was to look at the main site links and social engagements.</p>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucuriWebSocialImpact.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64329" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SucuriWebSocialImpact.png?resize=577%2C304&ssl=1" alt="Sucuri Web / Social Sponsorship Impact" /></a>Sucuri Web / Social Sponsorship Impact\n<p>We generated 190 sessions total, the most coming from WordCamp US (at the time of the event, not leading up to it, or after). We generate over 500k sessions a month across all our platforms. This makes 190 total sessions over a six month period negligible.</p>\n<p>In my review, we looked at direct traffic from referrals and traced down the social <b>&#8220;thank you&#8221;</b> and <b>&#8220;promotions&#8221;</b> each event provided. It&#8217;s fair to note, that the lack of success in the measurable values above could be very closely be related to our ineffectiveness as an organization as well. We could just be really bad at working events; it’s an art in and of itself.</p>\n<p>I intentionally did not include marketing leads. For me, my focus is looking at what actually converts so when we go to events, we place more emphasis on qualified sales leads (opportunities) than marketing leads; I am not very big on getting into the card collection and SPAM business.</p>\n<p><b>What does this all mean?</b></p>\n<p>Well, if I was a rational person this would mean that as a premium service provider, investing in WordCamps doesn’t make sense. Trust me, I love the community. We are involved in many ways, but this is really too difficult to digest and justify. I wonder what happens when more companies, even the ones that I shared above, start doing the same mathematics.</p>\n<h1>The WordCamp Sponsorship Conundrum</h1>\n<p>The WordPress platform promotes the idea of Free and targets a very curious niche of people &#8211; self-service/Do It Yourself (DIY) types. By this self-proclaimed profile, they are not buyers of premium services; they are the ones that will invest sweat equity to build or find an alternative to their problem &#8211; <b>it just has to be free. </b></p>\n<p>This ideology is fine, but it also means that it frankly may not be the right market for most premium businesses. I would be remiss however, if I did not highlight the fact that a number of the sponsors for WCUS 2016 were premium service providers. The only challenge I would make to this claim is that just because they are sponsoring, doesn’t mean they are getting a return.</p>\n<p>I’d also challenge it and say some of them have a need to sponsor for some of the same reasons described above. Just because a premium service sponsors, it doesn’t mean their goal is defined purely around selling, in many instances it’s built around brand awareness and ambassadorship &#8211; especially unknown brands, or those with bad reputations. GoDaddy is a perfect example of this.</p>\n<p>Does this mean that there is no hope? No, I don’t think so. I just think we have to ask ourselves some key questions, both as organizations and a community. To assist in the conversation, I’ve highlighted a few areas that I find challenging as a business and encourage others to introduce their own. If nothing else, this can help both the Foundation and organizers alike better work with sponsors.</p>\n<h2>The Audience Quality Factor</h2>\n<p>When we turn our attention to WordCamps, events designed to promote and bring together these ideals, you realize that the problem with WordCamps for businesses is the audience.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m by no way saying that their current design is bad for what WordCamps were designed for. On the contrary, I&#8217;d say they&#8217;ve done an exceptional job sticking to their predefined audience, at least in terms of cost bracket. They don’t, however, do a good job of differentiating between the various personas in attendance. They’re all rolled up into one big bucket. This creates a severe imbalance between the economic investment and audience potential.</p>\n<p>This imbalance I think has to do with the quality of the audience. This is not meant to imply that the audience is not good in their own right, but from a company perspective not so much (i.e., as a potential customer). In a world where everything is expected to be free, and quickly commoditized, how do you bridge that divide?</p>\n<p>This also has residual effects as well into the quality that can be expected at the event, in terms of organization, presentation and speakers. There are so many different ways this can go, does it mean WordCamp Pro like events? I’m not sure, but what I do know is that in it’s current incarnation something has to give.</p>\n<p>Granted, this does not apply to everyone. I know a number of theme shops that bring and meet their customers at these events. Where closing one deal cannot only cover their costs, but set them up nicely for a couple of months.  My points here are more tailored at product / premium shops that are operating at a very different scale and configuration.</p>\n<h2>Increasing Number of Events Globally</h2>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WPWorldLogo.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6948" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WPWorldLogo.jpg?resize=200%2C160&ssl=1" alt="WordPress World" /></a>The sheer volume of camps and sponsorships presents a very big problem, not just for the Foundation but for businesses as well. Which ones do you invest in? Which will offer the most return?</p>\n<p>I assure you, these are the conversations that are occurring. There are so many, and it’s impossible to invest in them all (at least in a meaningful way). This will continue to put undue pressures on all the organizing teams looking to raise funds. I think you can see an example of this with this years WCUS 2016 sponsorships, a very different (stark) representation of today’s reality when it comes to sponsorships.</p>\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;m very familiar with the new Global Sponsorship opportunities the Foundation has put together. They&#8217;re divided by geographic region, and don&#8217;t include the main geographic events like WordCamp US and WordCamp Europe. The prices are below:</p>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GlobalSponsorshipOpportunities.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64326" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GlobalSponsorshipOpportunities.png?resize=730%2C143&ssl=1" alt="Global Sponsorship Prices" /></a>Global Sponsorship Prices\n<p>It’s definitely a great idea, but providing a large sum of cash that gets distributed across events that you may or may not attend isn’t something I’m particularly fond of. I worry about the longevity of this program, and while I know there are always new sponsors, what will the churn look like in the program. Only time will tell.</p>\n<h2>Impacts of a Corporation Type</h2>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, the entity responsible for facilitating the growth and management of WordCamps around the world is now known as the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/03/02/transitioning-to-wordpress-community-support/">“WordPress Community Support (WPCS) Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)”</a>. This new entity is a subsidiary of the WordPress Foundation, which is still a non-profit, and established in 2016 (Yes, Matt said it’d take effect in 2017 but I’m pretty sure that was in error).</p>\n<blockquote><p>After March 31, sponsorship payments sent to WordPress Foundation accounts will be returned to sender. Please send <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer-handbook/first-steps/budget-and-finances/running-the-money-through-wpcs/#sponsorship-revenue">revised payment instructions</a> to any sponsors who have not yet paid.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This new entity is what is known as a benefit corporation, and should NOT be confused with a b-corp. Although it is used in many instances interchangeably, there are a number of differentiating factors, the biggest being that to obtain a b-corp classification an entity must be certified.</p>\n<blockquote><p>B Corps are for-profit companies certified by the nonprofit B Lab to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Establishing a PBC to handle the WordCamps I firmly believe was done with the best of intentions for the community, but it does present a few challenges for private businesses. A PBC is still a private for-profit company. The biggest difference, however, is that unlike other corporation types (e.g., C, S, etc..) a PBC allows an organization to be a charter (or mission focused) in addition to more traditional goals of generating profits for its shareholders.</p>\n<p>This change is a bit more significant than might be implied when reading through <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/03/02/transitioning-to-wordpress-community-support/">the announcement</a>. One of the driving forces for the change was to make the sponsorship process easier for both the organizers and sponsors alike:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the main advantages to the change from the WordPress Foundation (a non-profit) to the WPCS (a public benefit corporation) is that the rules around sponsoring official WordPress events are much simpler.</p>\n<p>The people involved in overseeing the program have updated sponsor rules accordingly, to eliminate the barriers to value-adding stuff like direct links, discounts, and calls to action, while keeping the ones that helped us form such a trustworthy, community-focused sponsor program, like the rule about not using superlatives or unprovable claims.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As a prior WordCamp organizer, there is perhaps no greater challenge in my mind than asking people for money. While my experience was back in 2011, I can only imagine that the struggles are still the same and one of the things leveraged when pitching to companies are the benefits of a non-profit. The non-profit classification was not just about securing donations like venues (which is very important) but it’s critical for some in securing the dollars they require.</p>\n<p>For a company, it also makes it harder to justify the costs. As the dollar investment continues to increase, the one thing that could always be counted on was the non-profit status. By changing it to a private organization (on paper) it’s donating money to another company (regardless of what the mission may or may not be). This might not be a big deal for some, but when we start talking significant investments, it becomes a serious problem.</p>\n<h1>Incentivizing Businesses</h1>\n<p>When you read through the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/fundraising/wordcamp-sponsorship/#wordcamp-sponsorship-rules-for-2016">Sponsorship rules for 2016</a> the changes are not incentivizing enough for a business. The biggest change being the ability to print comparisons or introduce pricing on collateral, both of which are insignificant as you can account for most of your physical collateral to end up in the trash and difficult to track.</p>\n<p>I believe there will be, or are changes in the works, to include pricing on virtual print as well which will definitely be a positive move, but I defer to the ROI measurements above as well.</p>\n<p>While the idea of incentivizing a business might be repulsive, it’s a necessity. As a good friend of mine mentioned, it’s about exposure for businesses. If we’re investing significant dollars and being such pivotal players in the success of these events, then we’re going to ask for as much exposure as possible.</p>\n<p>We’re also going to push the limits of our imaginations and require some flexibility, in return I think most companies would willingly be open to negotiation and flexibility. If ROI is going to be based on exposure and brand awareness, we need to be able to capitalize on that.</p>\n<p>What might be interesting here is to perhaps do a survey of businesses, those that have been supporting the WordCamp communities for years, and take a poll. Maybe present some options and make them part of the process. Even if it’s a fixed list, maybe ask for a wishlist of things; things that can be discussed and openly taken into consideration.</p>\n<p>Like I tell my teams &#8211;<b>most reasonable people don’t need to always win, they just want to be heard and be part of the process.</b> This applies to companies as well. When it comes down to it, it’s but a few people at each organization that will be your evangelists.</p>\n<h1>WordCamp Sponsorship Can Work</h1>\n<p>I am not saying that sponsoring WordCamps is not valuable. I’m also not saying that it’s a lost cause working with WordCamps.  I am saying that it’s important to have a dialog if longevity is what we’re after in the community,  sponsorships are the bloodline that keep these events going.</p>\n<p>There is little that can be done about the growth of events or the new subsidiary (and I don’t think either is bad). They are today’s realities and as organizations we’ll have to work through them independently.</p>\n<p>The two areas I think can be improved on is the audience and how businesses are incentivized.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I’m not particularly hopeful of the audience, that’s a problem the community will need to solve and not necessarily something the Foundation should concern themselves with. If I were the Foundation, I would be doing exactly what they are doing &#8211;<b> keep the price as low as possible to make it reachable to everyone (need a low barrier to entry). </b>We’ve already seen a few events attempt this, and the best example in my opinion so far has been <a href="https://wooconf.com/">WooConf</a> and <a href="https://wpcampus.org/">WPCampus</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The one I’m more hopeful of is how businesses are incentivized. If we can agree that at a minimum all organizations are looking for exposure, then that should be the easiest place to start. A few examples might include: speaking guarantees, more prominent branding, access to some form of audience information. Yes, some of these are highly controversial, but I have faith that together we can make something work that is in line with the spirit of these events. I would also encourage other camps to look at <a href="https://2017.miami.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Miami</a>; beyond  having a Learn JavaScript Deeply track, they do an exceptional job with the way they engage with their sponsors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I share this post as a way to provide a perspective that I hope is unique and valuable. If it starts a discussion, and opens a better dialog between businesses, WordCamp organizers and the Foundation then I will consider it a success. Sponsors are a critical piece to the continued success and growth of these community events, and I’d like to ensure that continues.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 08 Dec 2016 04:36:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 2.7.3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"https://buddypress.org/?p=261855";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"https://buddypress.org/2016/12/buddypress-2-7-3/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:756:"<p>BuddyPress 2.7.3 is now available.

For the first time, WordPress is 100% translated into Urdu, the national language of Pakistan. Urdu is spoken by 100 million people in several different areas of the world, including India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Middle East.</p>\n<p>As part of the effort to bring the Urdu translation to 100%, WordPress developer Ahmad Awais <a href="https://ahmadawais.com/urdu-wordpress/" target="_blank">organized a small meetup in Lahore, Pakistan</a> during the <a href="https://wptavern.com/2nd-global-wordpress-translation-day-brings-780-translators-together-across-133-locales" target="_blank">2nd WP Translation Day</a> event. More than 60 attendees joined online and offline over the span of two days with many participating in the <a href="http://WP-Pakistan.Slack.com" target="_blank">WP-Pakistan Slack</a> team in the #translators channel.</p>\n<p>Having WordPress available in Urdu is a major milestone for the Pakistani tech community. It makes it possible for government websites to adopt the software.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The government websites are required to be accessible,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;While we are not there yet, there are efforts underway to make every government website available in both English and Urdu.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Awais cited the <a href="https://www.nadra.gov.pk/" target="_blank">National Database and Registration Authority</a> (NADRA) website as one example that has recently started using WordPress for its online portal. NADRA issues identity cards with CNIC numbers in Pakistan, similar to social security numbers in the US.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nadra-website.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nadra-website.png?resize=1025%2C720&ssl=1" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64303" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The NADRA site is far from perfect but is much better than other government sites,&#8221; Aawais said. &#8220;People have already started to notice that. There&#8217;s a pretty large developer community in Pakistan that&#8217;s connected to WordPress in one way or another, but on the consumer end &#8211; not so much.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Awais said many Pakistani media sites are powered by WordPress but adoption is slower when it comes to e-commerce. WordPress penetration in the enterprise sector is nearly non-existent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the 100% Urdu variant of WordPress will definitely help in the expansion for the local consumer-base,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;Web developers will find it easier to pitch WordPress as the go-to CMS for government, local, and higher education web properties as compared to other proprietary, closed-source Urdu CMS software. That alone can have a huge impact as far as the growth of the local WordPress community is concerned.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The concept of contributing back to open source software is still relatively new in Pakistan but Awais and his fellow translators and developers are working to change the general perception in their tech culture.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would like to request Foundation to pay more attention to regions like ours, where software developers, computer science students, and entrepreneurs seldom understand the concept of open source software,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;The concept of giving back and making it work to pay the bills is lost on simple and misunderstood questions of &#8216;Can people make money via Open Source?&#8217; and &#8216;What do you get by giving back and helping out for free?&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Believe me, these are tough questions to be answered when there are no huge WordPress supported companies picking up the tabs for those who are trying to give back,&#8221; Awais said. &#8220;Support for open source is a rare commodity here. I hope that changes in the next five years or so.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During the <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle" target="_blank">2016 State of the Word</a>, Matt Mullenweg said one of <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/805158678353608704" target="_blank">the Foundation&#8217;s new focuses</a> will be running educational workshops in developing nations. When asked about how this initiative will work during the Q&amp;A session, Mullenweg said they are still figuring it out but envision an open source curriculum with locally run classes and support.</p>\n<p>More than 100 translators participated in bringing the Urdu translation to 100% for WordPress. With the software now accessible to 100 million Urdu speakers, the region seems like a good candidate for an educational investment to bring more developers up to speed with using WordPress for commerce and government sites.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 07 Dec 2016 20:56:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"HeroPress: Full Circle: Life Lessons of a Perennial Entrepreneur";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1517";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"https://heropress.com/essays/full-circle-life-lessons-perennial-entrepreneur/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10454:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/120716-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: Take the time to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. You\'ll be glad you did." /><p>I didn’t go to college until I was in my 40’s. When I graduated high school I went to work for a family business.</p>\n<p>There has been one common thread throughout my adult career, my love for technology.</p>\n<p>I was 24 when I bought my first computer, it was PC running MS-DOS.</p>\n<p>Five years later, the company I was working for bought a computer program to manage their rental properties. I was responsible for using it and data entry. The program was written by a local software developer. He became a mentor and when problems arose with the code, he walked me through on the phone how to edit and compile the source code. (Yes, he left a copy of the source code on the computer &#8211; this was way before remote support was possible.) It was dBase II. Fast forward a few years later and he hired me as a part-time contractor to help him customize the codebase for his clients. It seemed I had a knack for writing code and troubleshooting bugs.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I would go on to purchase the source code from him and launch my own property management software company. I ran it for eight years, while I rewrote the entire codebase. My business grew. I learned a lot about sales, running a business and managing employees. Most importantly, I learned how to listen to clients and by doing so, I was able to create the products they needed to run their businesses.</p>\n<p>Then, Windows came onto the scene. My software was not Windows compatible. It was running on FoxPro, a Dbase III competitor for MS-DOS. My business plateaued and I was faced with another rewrite of the codebase to stay competitive. To top it off, I’d lost my only support person at the same time. These are the challenges most small business owners face at some point. I was experiencing burnout and needed a change. Long story short, I eventually sold the software line to a competitor who was looking to expand their user base and incorporates some features that were in demand that my product had. It was win-win for both of us and to this day &#8211; I&#8217;m still happy about that transaction.</p>\n<p>I went on to work at a boutique consulting services firm in Houston, Texas as an Account Manager to large Fortune 500 clients, mostly in the energy sector. It was an amazing experience and I learned a lot about working in the enterprise space. This was very different from working with the small property management companies I had previously serviced. It was a great four years. The last year boomed as many clients scrambled to complete their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K upgrades</a>.</p>\n<p>In the spring of 2000, everything changed. The company had been acquired, and the dot-com bubble had burst. All the Y2K work was done and the world did not end. I decided to take some time off.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2000, I enrolled at a local community college. I spent the next two years and half years completing my core curriculum and then transferred to Texas A&amp;M in 2003 to complete a Bachelor of Science degree in Horticulture.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Horticulture?</strong> I’ve always loved gardening and jumped at the opportunity to learn everything I could about it.</p>\n<p><strong>Life Lesson:</strong> In hindsight &#8211; I wish I would have completed a degree in Computer Science. It was a bit of my own arrogance, that since I had run a software company and worked at a consulting firm, I knew all I needed to know. Truth was, I didn’t and would have benefited greatly from that experience.</p>\n<h3>Trying to make a hobby into a business.</h3>\n<p>In 2003, I decided to open an online store to sell home and garden gifts. I built a website using the Yahoo Store platform, and for the next 5 years watched it grow.</p>\n<p>My first introduction to WordPress came when I wanted to start a blog for the store. I like the idea of a self-hosted solution and loved getting back into programming.</p>\n<p>I went from running the business from my home to a small warehouse. It was 2007 and the housing market was booming. I jumped at the opportunity to lease a much larger warehouse with a retail storefront.</p>\n<p>There were important life lessons in it. One that made a strong impression on me was best described by the character Justin Matisse in the movie Hope Floats:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re talkin&#8217; &#8217;bout the American Dream. You find something that you love, and then you twist it, and you torture it, try and find a way to make money at it. You spend a lifetime doing that. At the end, you can&#8217;t find a trace of what you started out lovin&#8217;. &#8220;</p></blockquote>\n<p>That’s how I felt sometimes when running my store. What I loved about the home and garden space and trying to make money at it were sometimes at odds with each other. I loved designing the website, adding functionality and mastering the art of improving the SEO of the site.</p>\n<p>I was about to learn a very painful and valuable lesson. I was financing the growth with debt. I got caught up in the growth curve and was sure that things would just keep getting better, allowing me to pay down the debt. Indeed servicing the debt was not a problem, as sales continued to grow.</p>\n<p>Then came 2008 and the Great Recession. For the next three years, I watched sales decline, my credit lines pulled and my business contract. That made servicing the debt, really hard. I was stuck in a lease that I could not afford. Many of the vendors I bought products from went out of business. Everyone was hurting. <strong>I was not financially prepared for it.</strong></p>\n<p>In the end, a chain of events led to a huge financial mess &#8211; one that to this day, I am still recovering from. In 2011, I liquidated the inventory, sold my online store to a third-party and moved on.</p>\n<h3>Transitioning to WordPress</h3>\n<p>I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do at that point. I was depressed and dealing with the financial fallout of losing my business.</p>\n<p>I wrote content for a garden center and slowly began working on websites for others. I chose to use the Genesis Framework and began customizing their themes for clients. I liked it because it leveraged the power of hooks and filters in a way that made sense to me &#8211; and the Genesis community is amazing.</p>\n<p>I worked in real estate for a while to help pay the bills, but it just wasn’t right for me.</p>\n<p>During this transition period, I used the time to improve my web development skills. I began working with WordPress every day, learning everything I could. I took online courses in HTML, CSS and PHP.</p>\n<p>Today, I’m running my own business again, building websites and helping clients promote their digital brand. I learned a lot about SEO running my eCommerce business, how to market products, write copy and promote my brand. Now I’m helping clients do that.</p>\n<p>With decades of business experience along with some hard life lessons, here’s what I’ve learned so far:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don’t assume things will continue in the same direction. Business is cyclical, so like a squirrel &#8211; stash away some nuts for the winter.</li>\n<li>Stay out of debt.</li>\n<li>Know when to hold &#8217;em and when to fold &#8217;em. Sometimes hindsight helps make this clearer, but trust your gut and follow your instincts.</li>\n<li>Be helpful to others. Take time to share what you’ve learned, make friends and enjoy the ride.</li>\n<li>Learn from every engagement, and take steps to improve how you communicate.</li>\n<li>Be a Life-Long Learner. Dedicate time to experiment, think and try new things.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, if you’re considering a career in web design and development in WordPress, take the time to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. You’ll be glad you did.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Full Circle: Life Lessons of a Perennial Entrepreneur" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Full%20Circle%3A%20Life%20Lessons%20of%20a%20Perennial%20Entrepreneur&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffull-circle-life-lessons-perennial-entrepreneur%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Full Circle: Life Lessons of a Perennial Entrepreneur" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffull-circle-life-lessons-perennial-entrepreneur%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffull-circle-life-lessons-perennial-entrepreneur%2F&title=Full+Circle%3A+Life+Lessons+of+a+Perennial+Entrepreneur" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Full Circle: Life Lessons of a Perennial Entrepreneur"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/full-circle-life-lessons-perennial-entrepreneur/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/120716-150x150.jpg&description=Full Circle: Life Lessons of a Perennial Entrepreneur" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Full Circle: Life Lessons of a Perennial Entrepreneur"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/full-circle-life-lessons-perennial-entrepreneur/" title="Full Circle: Life Lessons of a Perennial Entrepreneur"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/full-circle-life-lessons-perennial-entrepreneur/">Full Circle: Life Lessons of a Perennial Entrepreneur</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 07 Dec 2016 12:30:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"Jackie D&#8217;Elia";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"WPTavern: Pantheon’s $100K WordCamp US Sponsorship Revoked the Night Before the Event";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=64248";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"https://wptavern.com/pantheons-100k-wordcamp-us-sponsorship-revoked-the-night-before-the-event";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8493:"<p>Nearly 2,000 people descended on Philadelphia, PA to attend WordCamp US last week. On the night before WordCamp US took place, <a href="https://pantheon.io/">Pantheon&#8217;s</a> sponsorship was revoked and advertising materials, including the company&#8217;s booth, were hidden in a storage room inside the venue. The move generated a <a href="https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber/status/804721149900890112">lot of controversy</a> on social media and at the event. It cost Pantheon $100K to sponsor WordCamp US, but the company received a refund.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our booth disappeared but the team\'s still here! Look for us in yellow! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCUS?src=hash">#WCUS</a> <a href="https://t.co/lnF5aI36oy">pic.twitter.com/lnF5aI36oy</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Pantheon (@getpantheon) <a href="https://twitter.com/getpantheon/status/804715506674626560">December 2, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Prior to WordCamp US Matt Stodolnic, Pantheon&#8217;s Vice President of Marketing, contacted the <a href="http://www.sheratonphiladelphiadowntown.com/">Sheraton Downtown Philadelphia</a> and inquired about advertising opportunities. The Sheraton <a href="http://www.sheratonphiladelphiadowntown.com/philadelphia-meetings">hosts a number of meetings</a> and has a couple of different advertising packages available. Stodolnic purchased advertising space on the hotel&#8217;s elevators. The advertising material was simple and didn&#8217;t make unprovable claims, such as the world&#8217;s best or fastest host. This is in line with the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/fundraising/wordcamp-sponsorship/#wordcamp-sponsorship-rules-for-2016">sponsorship rules</a>.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PantheonElevatorAdvertising.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64262" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PantheonElevatorAdvertising.png?resize=629%2C806&ssl=1" alt="Pantheon\'s Elevator Advertising" /></a>Pantheon&#8217;s Elevator Advertising\n<p>On December 1st late at night, Stodolnic received an email from WCUS organizers requesting that the advertising material be removed. Stodolnic pushed back as the sponsorship agreement does not specifically prohibit advertising in the hotel. At one point during the exchange of emails, the WCUS organizing team threatened to take the banners down themselves. Stodolnic responded with anger as the purchase had already been made but he quickly apologized.</p>\n<p>The issue was eventually escalated to Matt Mullenweg, co-creator of the WordPress open source software project, who revoked the company&#8217;s sponsorship of the event for violating the code of conduct. Later that night, WCUS organizers deconstructed Pantheon&#8217;s booth and moved it to a storage room along with 600 T-shirts printed by the company.</p>\n<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PantheonsBoothBefore.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64259" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PantheonsBoothBefore.png?resize=981%2C734&ssl=1" alt="Pantheon\'s Booth at WCUS Before Being Taken Down" /></a>Pantheon&#8217;s Booth at WCUS Before Being Taken Down\n<p>Day one of WordCamp US went off without a hitch but it was slightly overshadowed by the sudden removal of Pantheon. A few Pantheon employees published unfavorable messages on Twitter about the situation. Those tweets have since been deleted. At the conclusion of day two, Cami Kaos, one of the lead organizers of WordCamp US, published a post on the <a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/">event&#8217;s blog</a> highlighting what happened.</p>\n<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SponsorUpdatePost.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-64261" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SponsorUpdatePost.png?resize=1004%2C739&ssl=1" alt="Archived Image of The Post Published on the WCUS Blog Explaining The Situation" /></a>Archived Image of The Post Published on the WCUS Blog Explaining The Situation\n<p>The post doesn&#8217;t specifically name Pantheon and says the sponsor in question violated the event&#8217;s <a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>. I spoke to a number of Pantheon employees who read the post and couldn&#8217;t identify the violation in question. Within hours of being published, the post was removed from the site without an explanation.</p>\n<h2>Cooler Heads Prevail</h2>\n<p>During day two of WCUS, Stodolnic and Pantheon Co-founder Josh Koenig, spoke to Mullenweg face-to-face in a closed-door meeting at the venue. What was said is unknown but when I asked Mullenweg what the result of the meeting was, he said, &#8220;I think we&#8217;re in a much better place.&#8221; He also didn&#8217;t comment when asked how Pantheon violated the code of conduct.</p>\n<p>After the meeting, Stodolnic told me that both sides agreed that communication could have been handled better and that cooler heads prevailed. Mullenweg wouldn&#8217;t comment when asked whether Pantheon was banned from sponsoring WordCamps in 2017.</p>\n<p>We now know that the official hotel for WordCamp US is an extension of the venue allowing organizers to enforce the code of conduct and sponsorship and principles agreements. It&#8217;s likely that due to this incident, the sponsorship agreement will be amended to specifically prohibit advertising in the official hotel at next year&#8217;s event.</p>\n<p>Pantheon is a six-year old company making inroads in the managed WordPress hosting space. Not being able to sponsor WordCamps in 2017, <a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2016/03/28/pantheon-joins-the-wordpress-global-community-sponsorship-program-in-2016/">as they did in 2016,</a> could derail their momentum in building brand awareness.</p>\n<h2>Is It Worth It to Sponsor WordCamps?</h2>\n<p>Many of the sponsors I spoke to at WordCamp US described what Pantheon did as genius and were disappointed that they didn&#8217;t think of it first. This opens the door to a wider conversation. Is it financially worth it to sponsor WordCamps and are there enough opportunities to see a return on investment?</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Tony Perez, <span class="st">CEO of Sucuri, started a <a href="https://twitter.com/perezbox/status/749283708209799168">passionate discussion</a> on Twitter around the value of sponsoring WordCamps. As the costs of sponsoring and the number of WordCamps increases, businesses will need to be more selective of which camps they sponsor.<br />\n</span></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wordcamp?src=hash">#wordcamp</a> sponsorships and today\'s businesses will be coming to a cross roads in the the not so distant future.. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wordpress?src=hash">#wordpress</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Tony Perez (@perezbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/perezbox/status/749283708209799168">July 2, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle">major announcements at WordCamp US</a> is that WordCamps will now run finances through a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/budget-and-finances/running-the-money-through-wpcs/">Public Benefit Corporation</a>. Previously, finances were run through the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/">WordPress Foundation</a>, a 501(c) non-profit entity which <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/03/02/transitioning-to-wordpress-community-support/">severely limited</a> what sponsors were able to do at events due to IRS regulations.

This release makes significant improvements to the new theme setup experience, inspiring the tagline: &#8220;Your site, your way.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-default-theme-twenty-seventeen-merged-into-4-7" target="_blank">Twenty Seventeen is making its debut in 4.7</a> as the first default theme designed for business websites. It beautifully showcases new features for theme developers and demonstrates many improvements to the setup process. Twenty Seventeen offers four customizable panels on the front page for displaying existing content, custom logo upload, fullscreen featured images, and brand new core support for video headers.</p>\n<div class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement(\'video\');</script><![endif]--><br />\n<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/files/2016/10/panels-ui-small.mp4">https://make.wordpress.org/core/files/2016/10/panels-ui-small.mp4</a></div>\n<h3>Starter Content and Edit Shortcuts</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 gives theme developers the ability to provide <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/30/starter-content-for-themes-in-4-7/" target="_blank">starter content</a>, such as a business info widget or a sample social icons menu. The content serves as a placeholder but doesn&#8217;t appear on the live site until the user has customized and published it.</p>\n<p>New <a href="https://wptavern.com/visible-edit-shortcuts-in-wordpress-4-7-makes-customizing-sites-easier" target="_blank">visible edit shortcuts</a> display a pencil icon on areas of a theme that can be customized. Clicking the icons will automatically open the correct panel for the setting, which saves users time that might otherwise have been spent hunting around for the right setting to adjust. Theme authors will need to add theme support as well as support for selective refresh in order to take advantage of this new feature.</p>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CustomizerShortcutButtons.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CustomizerShortcutButtons.png?resize=1025%2C544&ssl=1" alt="Visible Edit Shortcut Buttons" class="size-full wp-image-63883" /></a>Visible Edit Shortcut Buttons\n<p>The new starter content and edit shortcuts features, especially when combined, give theme authors the ability to make customization easier and faster for their users. Themes with dozens of customizer options that may have previously seemed complicated to set up may now be more approachable.</p>\n<h3>Improved Menu Building and Custom CSS with Live Previews</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 <a href="https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-feature-proposal-adds-content-authorship-to-menus-in-the-customizer" target="_blank">adds content authorship to menus in the Customizer</a>. Users can now create new pages while setting up menus, without having to navigate back to the admin. This makes for a smoother workflow when setting up a brand new site.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wptavern.com/a-preview-of-the-custom-css-editor-added-to-the-customizer-in-wordpress-4-7" target="_blank">Custom CSS with live previews</a> is also new in this release. Users can now tweak the appearance of themes and plugins and see the results instantly. Those who have been using Jetpack&#8217;s Custom CSS module should have a seamless migration. The new feature is fairly basic but extensible so <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/26/extending-the-custom-css-editor/" target="_blank">plugin developers can add additional functionality</a> on top of it.</p>\n<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WP47CustomizerCSSEditor.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WP47CustomizerCSSEditor.png?resize=1025%2C394&ssl=1" alt="CSS Editor in The WordPress 4.7 Customizer" class="size-full wp-image-63483" /></a>CSS Editor in The WordPress 4.7 Customizer\n<p>WordPress 4.7 is packed full of many other user-facing improvements that make managing and editing content easier:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PDF thumbnail previews for better document management</li>\n<li>User admin languages</li>\n<li>Media library is now searchable by file name</li>\n<li>Improved Custom Background Properties UI (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22058" target="_blank">#22058</a>)</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/28/editor-changes-in-4-7/" target="_blank">Editor changes</a>: easier access to most-used buttons, improved discovery for keyboard shortcuts in tooltips and dropdowns</li>\n<li>Customizer sliding panels UI is now faster, smoother, and more accessible</li>\n<li>oEmbed support for Facebook posts/activities/photo/videos/media/questions/notes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WP REST API Content Endpoints Added to 4.7</h3>\n<p>One of the most exciting improvements to WordPress for developers is the addition of the <a href="https://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-officially-approved-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-7" target="_blank">WP REST API content endpoints</a> for posts, comments, terms, users, meta, and settings. This API opens up new ways of accessing and presenting WordPress content in themes, plugins, and applications &#8211; both inside and outside of the traditional WordPress interface. The WP REST API now has an <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/" target="_blank">official reference for documentation</a> on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>A few highlights of additional improvements for developers include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-brings-custom-page-template-functionality-to-all-post-types" target="_blank">Post Type Templates</a> &#8211; custom page template functionality is now available to all post types</li>\n<li><a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-will-allow-developers-to-register-custom-bulk-actions-in-admin-list-tables" target="_blank">Custom bulk actions</a> &#8211; developers can register custom bulk actions for admin list tables</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/26/registering-your-settings-in-wordpress-4-7/" target="_blank">Expanded Settings Registration API</a> via register_setting()</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/09/08/wp_hook-next-generation-actions-and-filters/" target="_blank">WP_Hook overhaul</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress lead developer Helen Hou-Sandí led the 4.7 release with deputies Jeff Paul and Aaron Jorbin. A record-breaking 482 contributors had props on 4.7 and 205 of them were first-time contributors. More than 100 of those volunteers contributed to the Twenty Seventeen theme. Community translators made it possible for WordPress 4.7 to be available in 52 languages at release time and they also captioned the release video included below in 44 languages.

It’s named, as always, after a famous jazz musician, and this release is named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Vaughan">Sarah “Sassy” Vaughan</a>, an American jazz singer.</p>\n<p>The Release Lead for WordPress 4.7 was <a href="https://helen.blog/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> &#8212; who is also a WordPress Lead Developer, and the Director of Platform Experience at 10up. The Deputy Release Leads were <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17">Jeff Paul</a>, a Team Lead at XWP, and <a href="https://daily.jorb.in/">Aaron Jorbin</a>, the Director of Engineering at Some Spider. There were more than 475 total contributors to this release, and more than 200 were first time contributors!</p>\n<p>As always, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/06/introducing-wordpress-4-7-vaughan/">release video</a> that showcases the release highlights. This year, it was produced by Rami Abraham.</p>\n<div id="v-AHz0Ca46-1" class="video-player"><div><img alt="Introducing WordPress 4.7" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/AHz0Ca46/wp4-7-vaughan-r8-mastered_scruberthumbnail_0.jpg" width="1024" height="576" /></div><p>Introducing WordPress 4.7</p></div>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 includes so many changes and new features worth highlighting, I will note a few of what I consider the most important and noteworthy, but it is not all-encompassing. This has been the most productive release in a very long time.</p>\n<h3>WordPress REST API Content Endpoints</h3>\n<p>WordPress is now more extensible than ever before, thanks to the WordPress REST API and the Content Endpoints that have shipped with 4.7. The Content Endpoints are stage two of the REST API rollout, after the infrastructure was included <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-4-4/">in WordPress 4.4</a>.</p>\n<p>The Content Endpoints make it so developers can interact with all major content objects of WordPress: posts (including default and custom post types), terms, users, and comments.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to completely bypass the WordPress templating engine, now you can. You can use WordPress as a content store, and create a custom writing interface, or so many other things, thanks to this API that standardizes interfacing with WordPress.</p>\n<p>The implications for external applications are enormous. Third parties can now reliably anticipate how to work with any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>The WordPress REST API has reached a huge milestone, and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/19/wordpress-rest-api-success-metrics/">success metrics</a> have been created to track how things are going with it. But the core team already knows there is much left to do.</p>\n<p>With the <a href="https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-state-word-2016/">new development cycle</a> Matt Mullenweg announced at WordCamp US just last week, the REST API will be one of three parts of WordPress that will have a major release dedicated to enhacing it. The goal is to expand the endpoints to include all site management features of WordPress, so that someone (or WordPress itself) could completely rebuild the WordPress administration experience from scratch, using the WordPress REST API.</p>\n<p>I sincerely believe the REST API is a gamechanger for WordPress. Now, it&#8217;s your turn. Build stuff. Show the world what you&#8217;ve made! There will be official WordPress REST API showcase efforts underway soon to capture what folks are building.</p>\n<p>This project would absolutely not have happened without the following people: Ryan McCue and Rachel Baker for leading the effort, Daniel Bachhuber and Joe Hoyle for their constant work and guidance, K. Adam White for a huge 4.7 effort in project management and wrangling, and Helen Hou-Sandí for making the call to include the API in the release.</p>\n<p>Ready to get started with the WordPress REST API? The new <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/">REST API Handbook</a> will be the home for documentation going forward.</p>\n<h3>Twenty Seventeen</h3>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen is the latest default theme for WordPress, and I believe the best since at least Twenty Twelve. The new default theme has a great multi-section front page feature that offers a great solution for small businesses to highlight their work in a single page format, with large featured images throughout.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-26479 size-large" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/twenty-seventeen-promo-752x313.png" alt="twenty-seventeen-promo" width="752" height="313" /></p>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen was designed by Mel Choyce.</p>\n<h3>Adjusted editor layout</h3>\n<p>Many folks would consider it a minor change, but any change to the WordPress editor is a big one to me. As Andrew Ozz <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/28/editor-changes-in-4-7/">highlights in the Make Core post</a>, some of the buttons in the default editing toolbar have been moved around, based on statistics of usage.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30984" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-06-at-1.24.48-PM-752x447.png" alt="editor-toolbar-rearrangement" width="752" height="447" /></p>\n<p>Most notably, the headings drop down has been moved to the top row, and strikethrough and horizontal rule buttons have moved down. This is a good step in the right direction in supporting a better and easier to use editor.</p>\n<h3>New Customizer features</h3>\n<p>The WordPress Customizer is another of the three feature focus areas moving forward in WordPress development. And there&#8217;s a lot of new stuff in the Customizer with WordPress 4.7 that you should know about.</p>\n<h4>Video Headers</h4>\n<p>The new default theme supports <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/26/video-headers-in-4-7/">video headers</a>, a new feature in WordPress, managed within the customizer.</p>\n<h4>Visible Edit Shortcuts</h4>\n<p>The new visible edit shortcuts allow for someone using the customizer to see an icon next to the part of the page that is eligible to be edited in the customizer. It&#8217;s perhaps a small UX addition, but will be very helpful for folks customizing their websites.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30982" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-06-at-1.01.09-PM-752x405.png" alt="customize-icon" width="752" height="405" /></p>\n<h4>Create a Page Within a Menu</h4>\n<p>Finally, you can create pages from within the Menu Customizer. One of the most common site setup steps is to build your menu. But if you haven&#8217;t already created the pages you want to put there, you have to go do that and come back.</p>\n<p>Now users can create a page draft while in the Menu Customizer so that they don&#8217;t have to take unnecessary steps or understand the order WordPress expects. Small wins like this are invaluable for the new user experience.</p>\n<h4>Custom CSS</h4>\n<p>Creating custom CSS straight from the editor has long been a popular Jetpack feature, and it was ported to WordPress core.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30981" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screen-Shot-2016-12-06-at-12.59.04-PM-752x438.png" alt="wordpress-edit-css" width="752" height="438" /></p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t exactly what I&#8217;d call a best practice, but it&#8217;s a common one. I&#8217;ve used custom CSS myself many times, especially for small sites where I just wanted to get something small done quickly. This feature brings a common request to core, and helps someone customize their sites quicker and without a third party plugin.</p>\n<h4>Starter content for themes</h4>\n<p>I&#8217;m really excited about the new starter content that WordPress themes can now include. This allows for smarter demos, so that the user better sees what the theme is designed for.</p>\n<p>Helen has a whole post <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/30/starter-content-for-themes-in-4-7/">describing exactly how it works</a>, but this is another feature that takes something that was not great in WordPress (especially for free themes in the WordPress directory) and drastically improves it.</p>\n<p>I really look forward to seeing this in action, and look forward to see how adoption of this feature impacts both free and commercial WordPress theme ecosystems.</p>\n<h3>Post type templates</h3>\n<p>Pages have long support custom templates for WordPress themes to define, and now this feature has been <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/03/post-type-templates-in-4-7/">extended to all post types</a>, with opt-in support.</p>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s simple for theme authors to create a variety of templates so that content creators can pick and choose from a layout they want to utilize, just like they&#8217;ve always done for pages.</p>\n<h3>Check out the full field guide</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 packs a lot of punch, and I highly recommend looking through the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/12/05/wordpress-4-7-field-guide/">full field guide</a> on the various changes. I have not covered many of the developer focused features in this post, because Aaron has curated the Make Core posts that do a better job of it.</p>\n<p>Also check out the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.7">Codex page for WordPress 4.7</a> for more information on features and links to specific tickets.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>WordPress 4.7 is a monumental achievement and is the result of the efforts of hundreds.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to Release Lead Helen Hou-Sandí, the core team, and all contributors. While the scheduled and strict-date releases worked really well and kept WordPress coming out on time every four months or so, I&#8217;m excited to see how the new setup mixes things up for WordPress.</p>\n<p>This was a heck of a way to go out with the previous method.</p>\n<p>Go <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download WordPress 4.7</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 Dec 2016 19:28:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.7 “Vaughan”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4596";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/12/vaughan/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40344:"<p>Version 4.7 of WordPress, named “Vaughan” in honor of legendary jazz vocalist Sarah &#8220;Sassy&#8221; Vaughan, is available for download or update in your WordPress dashboard.

This can range from placing a business information widget in the best location to providing a sample menu with social icon links to a static front page complete with beautiful images. Don’t worry &#8211; nothing new will appear on the live site until you’re ready to save and publish your initial theme setup.</p>\n<div>\n<h3>Edit Shortcuts</h3>\n<div class="wp-video"><a href="https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/edit-shortcuts.mp4">https://wordpress.org/news/files/2016/12/edit-shortcuts.mp4</a></div>\n<p>Visible icons appear to show you which parts of your site can be customized while live previewing.

Matt Mullenweg delivered his 11th annual State of the Word address to a rapt audience ready to celebrate WordPress&#8217; progress over the past year and hear the project leader&#8217;s vision for 2017.</p>\n<p>He began by thanking sponsors and volunteers who made the event possible by covering the bulk of the $516 actual cost per person. Mullenweg said sponsors cover roughly 85-95% of the cost of WordCamps worldwide. In 2016, the events sold a total 36,000 tickets, with costs subsidized by more than 1,000 sponsors.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg said meetups are the leading indicator for WordCamps and these events have had the fastest growth the community has seen in five or six years. More than 62,566 people attended a local meetup in 58 countries and roughly one third of those were new members.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s been a great year for WordCamps and meetups &#8211; 115 total WordCamps hosted in 41 different countries. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a> <a href="https://t.co/yVGkT0j52C">pic.twitter.com/yVGkT0j52C</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp US (@WordCampUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/805156784763715584">December 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>WordPress Foundation to Create WordPress Community Support Subsidiary</h3>\n<p>In order to better accommodate the extraordinary growth of the global community, the WordPress Foundation will be restructuring its management of WordCamps. In 2016 the Foundation took in an estimated $4.3 million, up from $2.8 million in 2015, with 99.9% of those funds related to WordCamps. Mullenweg announced that the 501c nonprofit will move WordCamps to its own company, WordPress Community Support, forming a PBC (Public Benefit Corporation) that is fully owned by the Foundation.</p>\n<p>He explained that if certain things happened at WordCamps it could endanger the overall Foundation, so WordCamps will now be managed under their own entity where the events will have a little more flexibility in how they do things. The Foundation plans to support some like-minded nonprofits that are aligned with the overall education mission of the organization, including <a href="http://www.hackthehood.org/" target="_blank">Hack the Hood</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/index.php" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>, and <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/" target="_blank">Black Girls Code</a>. In 2017 the Foundation will also begin promoting hackathons to help nonprofits and NGO&#8217;s.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Foundation will focus on supporting like-minded non-profits, education/workshops, and hackathons that benefit non-profits/NGOs. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a> <a href="https://t.co/6VfdP82KuM">pic.twitter.com/6VfdP82KuM</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp US (@WordCampUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/805158678353608704">December 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Internationalization is Driving an Increase in Plugin Usage</h3>\n<p>Mullenweg shared a few stats about the plugin directory, which will soon be launching a new design with revamped search functionality. This year has seen a 20% increase in active plugin usage and a 34% increase in plugin downloads totaling 1.48 billion, which Mullenweg attributed to a spike in internationalization efforts over the past year. The number of translation contributors has grown from 5,000 in April 2015 to 17,000 as of November 2016.</p>\n<p>This year there were 1,598 plugins with language packs (up from 314 last year) and 1224 themes with language packs (up from 641 last year). Mullenweg noted that 2/3 of the world speaks one of 12 languages with native fluency and that WordPress covers all of these and many more. In fact, the 4.6 release shipped with support for 50 available languages. WordPress&#8217; top 10 plugins are now 82% complete in the top 12 languages.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The top 10 plugins are 82% complete in the top 12 languages. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a> <a href="https://t.co/LnpEGv0p7o">pic.twitter.com/LnpEGv0p7o</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp US (@WordCampUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/805161007349985280">December 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Mullenweg Continues to Push Calypso as the Future of the WordPress Interface</h3>\n<p>During the <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">2015 State of the Word</a>, Mullenweg gave attendees a homework assignment to &#8220;learn JavaScript deeply&#8221; and <a href="https://youtu.be/TX6dXRL-jPU?t=59m14s" target="_blank">promised to submit a JavaScript patch before 4.7</a> came out. He submitted his first pull request to Calypso yesterday, Automattic&#8217;s from-scratch rewrite of WP admin using Node and React.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com users have widely adopted the new interface for publishing. Mullenweg shared statistics showing that 68% of posts went through Calypso since its launch, 17% via mobile, and 15% through the traditional wp-admin. Mobile app and mobile browser usage are also up. &#8220;We now need to start thinking about mobile devices as the primary way people are going to interact with WordPress in the future,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>From the time it launched, Mullenweg has said that Calypso, or something like it, would be the future of the WordPress interface. He reiterated this in his 2016 address and has committed some of Automattic&#8217;s JavaScript developers from the Calypso team to contribute full-time to core.</p>\n<p>If Calypso has a chance at becoming a promising replacement for the WordPress admin, its creators will need to broaden its interoperability with the WordPress plugin ecosystem. Mullenweg announced that Calypso is now plugin aware and is open to plugins with over 1M active sites.</p>\n<p>The next step on Calypso&#8217;s roadmap is to bring in support for Automattic&#8217;s plugins &#8211; WooCommerce, Akismet, Jetpack, and VaultPress. Mullenweg said the big focus for 2017 is to make plugins Calypso-aware, starting with a handful of the most popular ones before opening it up to all plugins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The hope is that Calypso, or something like it, is actually what becomes the interface that drives WordPress,&#8221; Mullenweg said. Since no one is currently building anything like Calypso and targeting core, it looks like the technology behind WordPress.com will be driving the evolution of WordPress in 2017.</p>\n<p>If Mullenweg&#8217;s goal is to make Calypso the primary publishing engine for core WordPress, one of the major challenges will be getting plugin developers on board with building compatibility for what is currently an Automattic product. What are the implications of contributing to greater Calypso adoption? If core brings in the Calypso interface in the future, would Automattic push to include its Reader and other WordPress.com functionality, as it has in the mobile apps? These are questions developers will need to weigh when considering whether to pursue a more application-type experience via the Calypso interface.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">What\'s next for Calypso? We\'ll start bringing <a href="https://twitter.com/automattic">@Automattic</a>\'s plugins in. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a> <a href="https://t.co/RL8ZduRczM">pic.twitter.com/RL8ZduRczM</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp US (@WordCampUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/805165388006887424">December 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>WordPress Recommends Hosts Offering PHP 7+ and HTTPS by Default</h3>\n<p>WordPress core continues to update its recommendations and requirements with the help of hosts who are adopting the latest technologies. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/" target="_blank">official recommendation for WordPress hosting</a> is now PHP 7 or higher. After WordPress.com switched to be 100% on PHP 7, Mullenweg said the network&#8217;s performance doubled and CPU load fell in half. Just 4% of self-hosted sites are on PHP 7, but the new recommendation should help move more hosts towards getting their customers updated.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/VrQffeOtG0">https://t.co/VrQffeOtG0</a> has been 100% switched over to PHP7, bringing significant performance improvements. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a> <a href="https://t.co/MChiS9QBJh">pic.twitter.com/MChiS9QBJh</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp US (@WordCampUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/805164029371158528">December 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Beginning in 2017, WordPress will have progressive enhancement for certain features that are only available for encrypted sites. Mullenweg announced that WordPress.org is now tracking HTTPS adoption. So far 11.45% of active WordPress websites are on HTTPS and <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-will-only-recommend-hosting-companies-offering-ssl-by-default-in-2017" target="_blank">the project will no longer recommend hosts that do not offer it by default</a>. &#8220;We want to bring more of the web to be secure, which is especially important in the post-Snowden era,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<h3>Trying New Things: Major Changes Coming to WordPress&#8217; Core Release Cycle</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 release lead Helen Hou-Sandí joined Mullenweg on stage to highlight a few of the features and improvements that will be coming in the official release on Tuesday. The release is arguably one of the most exciting and successful updates for WordPress in some time, but Mullenweg has a new strategy for core development in 2017.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at a junction for WordPress where what got us here wont get us there,&#8221; Mullenweg said, after highlighting how the software&#8217;s market share has grown from 13.1% to 27.2% in the past five years.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg proposed a new structure for WordPress releases where design and user testing will lead the way. &#8220;I&#8217;m putting back on the &#8216;product lead&#8217; hat for 2017,&#8221; he said. The upcoming year will have no set release schedule. Mullenweg is upending WordPress&#8217; predictable release cycle in favor of tackling some larger items on the to-do list. He said the focus will be on performance and fixes to existing functionality in three main focus areas: WP REST API, the Editor, and the Customizer.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg said he is particularly interested in getting first-party usage of the REST API in the admin, in hopes of having it evolve to something the project can use for the next decade. If it doesn&#8217;t, he said core will consider bringing it back into a plugin specifically for developers.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg said he feels the editor does not represent the core of WordPress publishing, a sentiment that many users agree with. He hopes to steer it toward a more block-based approach that unifies widgets and includes an interface for shortcodes.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s vision for the Customizer is to see all aspects of WordPress become more instant and provide the same interface and UI affordances as the editor. He announced that Ephox, the company behind TinyMCE, has agreed to work with the project to improve the core editing experience.</p>\n<p>Shifting from a time-based release cycle to one that is more project-based is a major departure from WordPress&#8217; previous release philosophy of &#8220;Deadlines are not arbitrary.&#8221; The project&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/" target="_blank">philosophy page</a> identifies the practice of delaying releases for one more feature as a &#8220;rabbit hole&#8221; that has been tested and found to be unpleasant. The new approach to core development makes no guarantee that WordPress will have any releases in 2017.</p>\n<p>If the experiment is not a success, the project&#8217;s days of frequent and fast iteration may be over for awhile. Mullenweg is willing to risk it in hopes of being able to provide more product-based leadership that will distinguish WordPress from its proprietary competitors.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Words of wisdom from <a href="https://twitter.com/kristatippett">@kristatippett</a>: "We only learn to walk when we risk falling down&#8211;" <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a> <a href="https://t.co/6t5sD6Xjbm">pic.twitter.com/6t5sD6Xjbm</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp US (@WordCampUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/805170327726780416">December 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re trying to counter stagnation,&#8221; Mullenweg said when asked about the new approach to releases in the Q&amp;A segment. &#8220;Even though we&#8217;ve had lots of releases, certain parts of WordPress have stagnated and haven&#8217;t made the leaps that they could.&#8221;  He suggested that being part of a feature plugin team will give developers a way to be involved in more active releases and continue to build momentum for eventual inclusion of their projects in core.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg plans to identify a tech lead and a design lead and will be working with them as the overall product lead. He envisions that when one area of WordPress gets to the point where the software can ship significant user-facing improvements, a release will be born.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at the point now where the steps WordPress needs to take are more significant to get the other 73% of the web it doesn&#8217;t have yet,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>In a return to WordPress&#8217; poetic roots, he concluded by reading a poem called <a href="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/praise-song-day" target="_blank">Praise Song</a> for the Day by Elizabeth Alexander.</p>\n<p>The video of the State of the Word address will soon be available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpJf6LGZ0a4n9Lj4aVt9spg" target="_blank">WordPress&#8217; new YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 04 Dec 2016 18:50:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"Post Status: Matt Mullenweg State of the Word, 2016";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=30865";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-state-word-2016/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16796:"<p>Matt Mullenweg just completed the 2016 State of the Word presentation at WordCamp US 2016.</p>\n<p>This year, Matt focused on a variety of important topics, including the state of user experience in WordPress today, goals for future interface improvements, a WordPress growth council, internationalization gains, the further proliferation of secure websites, and important changes to the WordPress development process.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp US in Philadelphia</h3>\n<p>Matt began his talk by thanking the city of Philadelphia for being a great host of the first two WordCamp US events, as well as the sponsors, organizers, and volunteers that helped make WordCamp US one of the most successful and smoothest run WordCamps ever.</p>\n<p>He also said the per person cost for WordCamp US is over $500 per person, and that only the sponsors make that happen. And next year, WordCamp US is making its way to Nashville.</p>\n<h3>WordCamps and meetups in 2016</h3>\n<p>There were 116 WordCamps in 2016, and over 36,000 attendees, 2,056 speakers, 1,036 sponsors, and 750 organizers.</p>\n<p>There were 3,193 meetup events in 58 countries. These were attended by more than 62,000 people, or nearly double WordCamps.</p>\n<p>Matt says it&#8217;s the fastest growth there has been for these events in around five or six years. WordCamp Europe actually had more people than WordCamp US this year, which Matt took as a personal challenge for Nashville.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.tv/">WordPress.tv</a> published 26% more talks this year than the previous year, and now there is an official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/wordpress">WordPress channel on YouTube</a>, so more and more videos will begin to be available wherever people want to watch them.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp public benefit corporation and the WordPress Foundation</h3>\n<p>More than a year ago, work began to separate WordCamps from the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/">WordPress Foundation</a>, in order to make WordPress event organizing more flexible and to better protect the WordPress trademarks that the foundation holds.</p>\n<p>One of the things the foundation is going to start doing is support like minded non-profits, and in 2017 will be sponsoring three: Hack the Hood, the Internet Archive, and Black Girls Code.</p>\n<p>Also, the foundation will start to promote hackathons for non-profits and NGOs.</p>\n<h3>WordPress&#8217;s extended family</h3>\n<p>Matt gave a shoutout to WordPress&#8217;s &#8220;cousins&#8221; like BuddyPress and bbPress, highlighting a lot of features that have gone into the software in the last year.</p>\n<h4>BuddyPress and bbPress</h4>\n<p>WordPress.org itself uses BuddyPress and bbPress. For ages, it&#8217;s used outdated versions of bbPress, and in the past year launched a new support form that uses modern bbPress and WordPress profiles use bbPress. Matt says projects like these will get new support and engagement over the next year.</p>\n<h4>HackerOne</h4>\n<p>HackerOne is a security website that allows software organizations to offer bounties to hackers for responsibly disclosing security bugs.</p>\n<h4>GlotPress</h4>\n<p>GlotPress has had a big transformation in the last year, as it is no longer standalone software on top of BackPress, but rather a plugin for WordPress. If you&#8217;ve never been to <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/">translate.WordPress.org</a>, you&#8217;ve seen GlotPress in action, and it&#8217;s pretty amazing.</p>\n<h4>WordPress.org</h4>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress.org</a> is a central hub for the WordPress community. Matt highlighted some of the work that&#8217;s been going on this past year around languages, support forums, and more. He also says that new work will be going into P2/O2, which are used for the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org">Make WordPress</a> blogs.</p>\n<p>And he gave attention to the new WordPress plugin repository, which finally uses WordPress itself, and has a whole new design. You can see the new design in action on the new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins-wp/">demo site</a>, which should role out to the main Plugins directory soon.</p>\n<h3>WordPress in all languages</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.6 was available in 50 languages the day it was released. And the top 10 plugins are 82% translated in the top 12 languages used in WordPress.</p>\n<p>Language packs have been a huge help in helping translate plugins as a community project on Translate.WordPress.org, rather than having to ship translations inside the plugin itself.</p>\n<p>1,598 plugins are now using language packs, and 1,224 themes use them. This is huge for the future of WordPress working great in every language.</p>\n<p>Also, in WordPress 4.7, we&#8217;ll see per-user language choices.</p>\n<h3>Learning JavaScript Deeply</h3>\n<p>Last year&#8217;s homework for the community was to learn JavaScript deeply. He says that WordPress is 28% JavaScript now, which hasn&#8217;t changed, but he says we&#8217;ve still made a lot of progress.</p>\n<p>Matt gave himself a personal challenge to learn JavaScript, and he said that 364 days into this challenge, he submitted his first patch to Calypso (Automattic&#8217;s WordPress administration interface). He said, learning JavaScript and becoming as native with JavaScript as with PHP is going to be really important &#8212; especially as the REST API gets included in WordPress 4.7.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Growth Council</h3>\n<p>Matt recently posted about a WordPress Growth Council to help WordPress grow and maintain marketshare.</p>\n<p>He says that what got WordPress to where it is today, won&#8217;t get WordPress to where it can be tomorrow. He blogged about this <a href="https://ma.tt/2016/12/wp-growth-council/">new growth council</a>, which folks can apply for, which will help guide product direction in WordPress going forward.</p>\n<p>Matt actually said in Post Status Slack recently that if WordPress doesn&#8217;t make changes to the interface and otherwise, he&#8217;d expect WordPress marketshare would begin to decline by 2018.</p>\n<h3>HTTPS &amp; PHP7</h3>\n<p>11.45% of WordPress websites are now served via HTTPS. Matt talked last year about how LetsEncrypt and PHP7 were going to be a big deal, but they&#8217;ve turned out to be, &#8220;huge.&#8221; And WordPress will now start applying progressive enhancement techniques for WordPress websites.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com is now fully on PHP7, which he says was an enormous accomplishment. He&#8217;s also announced that <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/">WordPress.org will now recommend</a> PHP7 by default.</p>\n<h3>Calypso</h3>\n<p>Matt gave some updates on <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">Calypso&#8217;s</a> adoption since it was released last year. He says that 68% of posts on WordPress.com are now written in Calypso. 17% of posts are written via a mobile device, and only 15% of users are using the WordPress admin. For reference, Calypso is the default method of publishing on WordPress.com now, so that includes the desktop website, desktop app, and mobile app.</p>\n<p>Matt says that building Calypso is like, &#8220;building a plane while it&#8217;s flying.&#8221; And while it&#8217;s hard, he says it&#8217;s worth it, but it&#8217;s like rebuilding WordPress &#8212; which took 13 years to do &#8212; in only two years.</p>\n<p>The future of Calypso includes making it &#8220;plugin aware&#8221;, so that prominent plugins (most Automattic plugins included) would be recognized and manageable via Calypso.</p>\n<p>In fact, Calypso is plugin aware today, as the merge has just happened. So now plugins can include custom code to be manageable via Calypso. This is an interesting move to me, especially since Calypso &#8212; while open source &#8212; isn&#8217;t an official WordPress project, but rather an Automattic-owned interface.</p>\n<p>Matt says that someday he&#8217;s like to see Calypso, &#8220;or something like it,&#8221; eventually to become the WordPress interface.</p>\n<h3>Core releases in 2016</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.5-4.7 will have been released by the end of 2016. Matt says, &#8220;this is very much a year about doing things differently.&#8221; And in that spirit, he&#8217;s pre-announcing the jazz musician in the release. I&#8217;m sure Jeffro will be pleased <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" /> WordPress 4.7 will be named &#8220;Vaughan&#8221;, after jazz musician Sarah &#8220;Sassy&#8221; Vaughan.</p>\n<p>Helen Hou-Sandi came to the stage to discuss WordPress 4.7 in more detail.</p>\n<h3>WordPress 4.7</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 will include a variety of features, and will be released on Tuesday, December 6th.</p>\n<h4>New default theme</h4>\n<p>WordPress includes a new default theme that with a multi-section home page that&#8217;s a brand new WordPress feature. And generally Twenty Seventeen has a lot more broad base appeal for businesses and non-blogging applications than many past themes.</p>\n<h4>Theme setup process</h4>\n<p>Helen really wanted to focus on user interactions in WordPress 4.7. She used the example of her &#8220;tweet storm&#8221; about what it&#8217;s like to change a theme, which took dozens of steps and included a lot of unclear processes.</p>\n<p>Themes in 4.7 can define content that ships with the theme, such as a nav menu setup, sample page content, a password protected page, and other content that would be utilized in the theme. This will be a massive improvement in the initial theme setup experience that I love to see in 4.7.</p>\n<h4>Better menu handling</h4>\n<p>WordPress 4.7 includes better menu building that will also assist the new user experience. Now when you are building a menu in the customizer, you can add a page right from the menu screen, so that if you haven&#8217;t yet written your &#8220;about&#8221; page or whatever else, you&#8217;ll be able to create that draft straight from the menu screen, so the user doesn&#8217;t have to know exactly which flow is necessary to setup their site.</p>\n<h4>&#8220;Sleeper hits&#8221;</h4>\n<p>Helen highlights sleeper features, like thumbnail previews for PDFs and user dashboard languages so a user can use a different language than is set by the site administrator.</p>\n<h4>The WordPress REST API</h4>\n<p>To big applause, Helen noted the inclusion of the WordPress REST API Content Endpoints in 4.7. She says that she&#8217;s excited to take the momentum and excitement around the API and turn it into more real-world projects where people test and put it to practice.</p>\n<h4>Deputy leads</h4>\n<p>Jeff Paul and Aaron Jorbin were the deputy release leads for 4.7, and more than 475 contributors submitted code to 4.7. Over 200 of those contributors are first time contributors.</p>\n<h4>Sneak preview video</h4>\n<p>To end the preview of WordPress 4.7, Helen shared a sneak preview of the WordPress 4.7 video, created by friend Rami Abraham, that highlights &#8220;Carly&#8221;, who is a small business owner building her business website. The video shows a couple more great sleeper hits, like customizer preview icons to help editing, and video headers.</p>\n<h4>That&#8217;s WordPress 4.7</h4>\n<p>WordPress 4.7, I believe, is going to be one of the best releases we&#8217;ve seen in a long, long time. It&#8217;s jam packed, and while I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have plenty of follow-on work, there&#8217;s been a hugely ambitious effort with tons of awesome contributors. None of it would&#8217;ve happened without Helen.</p>\n<h4>WordPress REST API and examples</h4>\n<p>After the video, Matt came back on stage.</p>\n<p>Matt highlighted some of the REST API examples, including the new <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/">Guggenheim Museum</a> website and <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/">Vocativ</a>, which both use the new API, and are powered by Content Endpoints.</p>\n<h3>A look at the past and future</h3>\n<p>Matt spent a few minutes reflecting over this past, and busy, year; but also spent time discussing the past few years and what&#8217;s in store in the future.</p>\n<p>Matt recognized the &#8220;predictable&#8221; release cycle that we moved to around WordPress 3.8, and how that&#8217;s been a huge benefit for the platform in general.</p>\n<p>In the past five years, we&#8217;ve seen WordPress go from 13.1% to 27.2%, and this kind of marketshare for a CMS is &#8220;unprecedented.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He says, &#8220;What can we try next?&#8221; In other words, he wants to do things differently going forward: &#8220;What got us here, won&#8217;t get us there.&#8221; In order to do this, he&#8217;s proposing a new structure for core development.</p>\n<p>Matt said he wants to see a simpler, faster UX, while simultaneously making it more powerful. This has been my number one goal for WordPress the last few years, so I&#8217;m thrilled to see him highlight it. In the coming releases, he, &#8220;wants to see design leading the way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 2017, Matt says he&#8217;s going to be a heavily involved project lead again.</p>\n<h3>No set major releases in 2017</h3>\n<p>Matt made a huge announcement by saying that there will be no set releases in 2017. WordPress Core will continue to move forward, managing maintenance and other items, but will shift to three main focuses for features that will dictate the next several major releases:</p>\n<h4>1) The WordPress REST API</h4>\n<p>He says we need shift from thinking about the input, to measuring the output. He wants the conversation of success metrics to get beyond the &#8220;thousands&#8221; when, &#8220;WordPress is in the tens of millions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Matt sees powering the WordPress admin with the REST API as a core focus for 2017. In addition, this effort will include shipping authentication tools in WordPress core, so that external applications can connect to WordPress websites. He says if we can&#8217;t move forward with this goal, then we need to consider making the API a plugin again.</p>\n<h4>2) The Editor</h4>\n<p>Matt wants to see a lot of work on the WordPress editing experience. Matt says he showed &#8220;block-baced editor&#8221; (some may remember this as &#8220;content blocks&#8221;) in a State of the Word slide a few years ago, and calls the WordPress editor his &#8220;white whale&#8221;.</p>\n<p>He says we need to be candid about our shortcomings with WordPress so that we can more effectively move forward. Andrew Ozz and Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe have been massively influential on the editor improvements we&#8217;ve seen over the past few years, and their contributions will be huge for moving this goal forward.</p>\n<h4>3) The Customizer</h4>\n<p>&#8220;The customizer is not yet fast enough, and flexible enough, to meet our current needs.&#8221; He&#8217;s excited to see all the new work going into the customizer, but knows there&#8217;s a lot of work to do to take the customizer to the next step.</p>\n<h3>How to get these goals accomplished</h3>\n<p>He says that new major versions of WordPress will not be released until these features are ready. He says that as each project is completed, there will be a major release to go around it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fascinated by this new approach. It&#8217;s like taking the current feature project framework and taking it multiple levels up. It&#8217;s definitely a way to shake things up, and that may be great, considering so many people in the WordPress space enjoy complaining about the slow process that is WordPress feature development.</p>\n<p>Matt, as project lead, says he&#8217;ll personally be taking these on as the lead. And work will begin immediately to make it happen.</p>\n<p>So, I don&#8217;t know if the next release will be called WordPress 4.8, or when it will be, but I&#8217;d be shocked if it&#8217;s four months like past releases. But I guess we&#8217;ll see a lot of minor releases for all the other aspects of core development.</p>\n<p>Matt says he thinks we&#8217;ll fall while we learn to walk in this new way, and that&#8217;s okay.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I have to admit, these are some pretty surprising announcements. I&#8217;m excited to dig more into the particulars over the coming weeks, but I do think this serves as a worthwhile and important jolt into WordPress core development. That&#8217;s not to say I think WordPress development has been bad, I think it&#8217;s been great.</p>\n<p>Matt finished by reading a poem by Elizabeth Alexander, titled, &#8220;<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/52141">Praise Song For The Day</a>&#8221; that marked a fitting end to the talk.</p>\n<p>I think the key takeaway should be like he said: &#8220;what got us here, won&#8217;t get us there.&#8221; Let&#8217;s see how this goes.</p>\n<p><em>Photo credit: Brian Richards for Post Status.</em></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 03 Dec 2016 22:20:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"Matt: WordCamp Live Stream";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46945";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"https://ma.tt/2016/12/wordcamp-live-stream/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:298:"<p>Later today (3:45pm ET) I&#8217;ll deliver my annual State of the Word speech, which I&#8217;m very excited about.

The Japanese development company specializes in WordPress and AWS integrations. Shifter was built by the same team behind the company&#8217;s <a href="https://amimoto-ami.com/" target="_blank">Amimoto</a> cloud hosting platform.</p>\n<p>Shifter converts WordPress sites into a series of static HTML files and serves them up via a global CDN (AWS) for high performance hosting, eliminating the burden of software maintenance and server updates. The product targets websites that have a low frequency of updates, such as business or portfolio sites, as well as maintenance and support providers.</p>\n<p>Shifter allows site owners to turn WordPress on or off in its administration center. The service is a hybrid of a WordPress static site generator and a hosting solution. Shifter hosts the static files it creates and allows users to connect their domains. It leaves the standard WordPress management and administration workflow intact and compiles a new version of the static files anytime users update content inside WordPress. The service starts at $30/month and offers support for unlimited sites.</p>\n<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shifter-dashboard.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shifter-dashboard.png?resize=1025%2C652&ssl=1" alt="Shifter dashboard" class="size-full wp-image-64166" /></a>Shifter dashboard\n<p>As the first commercial product to provide serverless WordPress hosting, Shifter offers a unique way to tackle the security concerns that plague WordPress and its plugins and themes. Because the software is used by more than 27% of all websites, it has become a big target for hackers and spammers alike. Shifter&#8217;s creators see WordPress as a prime candidate for serverless architecture.</p>\n<p>DigitalCube team members met the Philadelphia-based <a href="http://j2made.com/" target="_blank">J2 Design</a> company at last year&#8217;s WordCamp US and partnered with them to improve their branding, copy writing, and approach.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At that time, we were having problems in design, branding, and communication,&#8221; product liaison Shinichi Nishikawa said. &#8220;The name &#8216;Amimoto&#8217; was originally a Japanese word and was difficult for people to pronounce or remember. We saw their work and asked them if we could form a partnership.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Together the Amimoto and J2 Design teams took the project from concept to launch in about three months. They built Shifter with AWS, Docker, and the Serverless Framework. The development team behind the project also supports and manages sites such as The Japan Times, AOL Japan, and Mazda. They frequently contribute to open source projects, including WordPress, Serverless Framework, and WP-CLI.</p>\n<p>Shifter has exited beta and the company has <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/225627578/shifter-serverless-hosting-for-wordpress" target="_blank">launched a Kickstarter campaign</a> with a $10,000 goal to fund future development on the project&#8217;s <a href="https://getshifter.io/blog/development-roadmap/" target="_blank">roadmap</a>, including domain mapping, a way to visualize usage of bandwidth and storage, multi-factor authentication, advanced scheduling, and WP-CLI support.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 03 Dec 2016 03:44:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"Matt: WP Growth Council";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46933";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"https://ma.tt/2016/12/wp-growth-council/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1594:"<p>In the WordPress world, when we look back an 2016 I think we&#8217;ll remember it as the year that we awoke to the importance of marketing.

The company is rebranding the product as &#8220;Local by Flywheel&#8221; and plans to create a Windows application, add off-site backups for local sites, and sell premium support.</p>\n<p>“From the start, the application encompassed so many of Flywheel’s core values: speed, simplicity, and allowing designers and developers the freedom to do what they love,&#8221; Flywheel CEO and co-founder Dusty Davidson said. &#8220;It’s a perfect fit.”</p>\n<p>Griffiths told the Tavern that he is excited for the opportunities that Flywheel can provide for Local going forward. &#8220;I originally built Pressmatic because I saw the gap that existed for a truly great local WordPress development experience, and now with the resources and team at Flywheel we&#8217;re set to really build something great,&#8221; Griffiths said. &#8220;I certainly could have continued to go at it alone, but after meeting the team it became clear that the right answer was to partner up and really go big.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Griffiths Plans to Continue Headway Themes Support and Development in his Spare Time</h3>\n<p>The acquisition comes just months after Griffiths, who is also the co-founder of Headway Themes, was embroiled in the controversy surrounding the company&#8217;s lack of communication and decline in support.

The application was built on top of <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" target="_blank">Electron</a>, an app framework that enables developers to build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I am a digital tinkerer who has fallen in love with and currently gone steady with WordPress. Still, the journey is rough.</p>\n<p>A little about my home country before you hear my story…</p>\n<h3>Malawi</h3>\n<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=malawi"><img class="alignright wp-image-1507" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/googleit.gif" alt="Gif of guy reading book, another guy slapping it away, saying Google It" width="295" height="166" /></a>Malawi, is at the time of my writing, the poorest country in the world. A tiny land locked country with a population of 17 million, AND still largely rural (about 75%) and struggling to develop.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The average entry level monthly pay for skilled jobs is about $110.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You are really fortunate if you are employed, young, working in the creative industry and earning somewhere near $300 a month. I doubt if anybody <em>actually</em> <strong>employed</strong> by someone in the design, creative and web services industry earns this much.</p>\n<p>That being said, I have been a freelance graphic designer since about 2011, doing gigs from my dorm room in college and my bedroom at home. Earnings from my freelance gigs increased my interest in entrepreneurship and I soon started entertaining the thought of starting my own creative agency or media powerhouse.</p>\n<h3>HOW I FIRST CAME INTO CONTACT WITH WORDPRESS</h3>\n<p>I first came into contact with WordPress in 2014 when a friend of mine from University were planning to start a local tech blog. Before WordPress, all I had was basic and outdated HTML knowledge I learned from high school and some knowledge in Adobe Dreamweaver.</p>\n<p>In 2014 very few websites in Malawi actually ran on WordPress as far as I remember. Most of the websites made in Malawi looked pretty archaic. With what to me was my partners expertise with WordPress Our blog looked like it came from the future. My partner knew where to get the themes (I did not know how he did it then, and still understood very little about WordPress).</p>\n<p>In a little while, ecstatic from the praise and positive feedback from the blog we decided to pursue the idea of opening our own content and media publishing outfit.</p>\n<p>Because our blog looked spectacular we got a few web redesign jobs thanks to the exposure the blog brought. We were ecstatic.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we both had very little administrative and business skills we could not maintain the business and we ended up going our separate ways.</p>\n<p>Fast forward post college, out of my first real job that I got in the TV industry ( terrible pay, overworked, and not being paid for about 5 months!) and failing to get more rewarding gigs as my creative agency start up side was cash strapped.</p>\n<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1509" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/rowan.gif" alt="Rowan Atkinson looking shocked" width="355" height="200" />I finally took it upon myself to learn the ins and outs of WordPress. I learned how to install WordPress on a server and did some research on customising Themes. That knowledge alone and presto: I got my first web design clients and started making earning nearly as much as I did at my first job, sometimes a little more, when I get fortunate  some times I even earn three times as much as I used to in a month.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It only took a very short while for me to realise that free WordPress themes can only go so far, especially with my limited code skills.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For most WordPress designers in Malawi, all we did was get nulled themes and customise them. This is the way most WordPress designers in developing countries survive. This is also why I would like to build my own themes from scratch, to avoid the situation where I have to use pirated themes that are not only unsafe for clients but unethical. In addition, I know learning to code will also set me apart from my competition.</p>\n<p>Which leads me to the next bit….</p>\n<h3>HOW THE LACK OF AN ONLINE PAYMENT SOLUTIONS AFFECTS DESIGNERS/DEVELOPERS IN COUNTRIES LIKE MINE</h3>\n<p>My country apparently has PayPal “available”, but the truth is you cannot get yourself a credit card to be able to join creative markets, and do online courses in order to improve your WP skills. The banks here only issue out credit cards to people who travel overseas or apparently have millions in their bank account.</p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/city.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1510 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/city-1024x576.png" alt="City Street in Malawi" width="960" height="540" /></a></p>\n<p>Even so, most of the bank personnel themselves know very little about credit cards and let alone online payment solutions. It is often very frustrating to talk to bank personnel concerning this. Wire transfer and Western Union is still the most popular way to make transactions for goods and services. So many services that we would like to access: plugins, features, etc related to the WP community are far from our reach. The learning and growth often stops the moment you see the “$” sign on websites offering WP solutions and themes.</p>\n<h3>THE CHALLENGES OF BEING SELF TAUGHT IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD</h3>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, I do not have any programming background, I have always been more of a creative and artsy kind of person. Sure I have an eye for design but in order to grow, I need to learn to code PHP, and PHP hard and it is not easy to do so as premium online courses are inaccessible.</p>\n<p>When you are in a position like mine, you are already deep in freelancing and getting a job is currently not the best option because the pay is terrible for people in your industry, and you have to keep on earning, plus make time to learn code. Getting to actually code well is a chore as you have to mind all the other obligations.</p>\n<p>Between the time to make pitches to clients, finish up graphic design projects, deal with our current load shedding program (we only have about 5 hours of power a day on average now! ) is something I am barely managing.</p>\n<p>Teaching myself code, HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, and PHP for WordPress is something I am determined to do and always in the process of. I try my best to make time to learn. I reckon this would have been easier if I studied a programming course in college but well, here I am.</p>\n<h3>WHAT THE WORDPRESS COMMUNITY LOOKS LIKE TO ME</h3>\n<p>I will be honest, I have only gotten in touch with the actual WordPress community only very recently. Of course I search for solutions from blogs about WordPress but never actually talked to or asked anyone from the community for a solution. The most personal interaction I have ever had with anyone from the WordPress community is when I talked to <a href="https://twitter.com/topher1kenobe">Topher</a> when I applied to write a post for HeroPress.</p>\n<p>I often just isolated myself from any attempt to interact at all because of the glass ceiling. There are these feelings you get; these things you tell yourself when you know you can never truly harness the power of WordPress because of your lack of a way to pay for stuff online: You could never be half as good as anyone in developed countries, you will never ever get premium support, you can never be eligible for premium support. I reckon these feelings are worse for people teaching them self how to code like me.</p>\n<p>So when I came across a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/heropress">@HeroPress</a> about a post that talked about how WordPress marginalises some, it piqued my interest. It was a post from a WordPress developer in India, and it detailed how people from developing countries could never paid the same way someone from the developed countries would for the same skills or services. I totally relate and knew right away I need to sign up to tell my story.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress designers and wanna-be developers like me (who cannot access online pay systems) often feel side lined.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When it comes to classes, we stop at the freebies portion, often than not our Google Searches look like this</p>\n<p>“Free image slider plugins for WordPress” “Free WordPress tutorials”</p>\n<p>I wish more developers, or people with more global privilege would consider alternate ways for users who cannot pay for courses, themes, or plugins would make. We may not seem to be present, but we are there. I would love to see more WordPress tutors and developers open up ways to accommodate aspiring learners like me who cannot access plugins, courses and themes, to be able to give back and to participate at another level.</p>\n<p>Many wannabe developers who come from situations similar to mine often shy away from participating with the WordPress community or getting deeper with WordPress because in the ways I have mentioned above, the WordPress community feels like it belongs to those only privileged enough on the internet.</p>\n<p>WordPress has allowed me to find income I otherwise would not have any way in hopes of earning. Sure it is lower by global standards, but it makes a huge difference where I live. This is about to be my second year with WordPress, and coming across members of the community with varying backgrounds through HeroPress’ stories tells me there is hope for WordPress users like me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I believe through sharing stories like these not only will WordPress products/services be more accessible but aspiring self-taught developers like me will also find more courage in reaching out to connect with others out there.</p></blockquote>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div

Before I got married, I was staying in Chapra, a small city in Bihar. I had graduated in Botany, we only had electricity for 5-6 hours a day and no easy access to internet or computers.</p>\n<p>After my marriage, I came to Pune, a bigger city compared to Chapra and things changed for me. I was exposed to exciting world of technology, thanks to my husband who was then working at a startup. I had lot of free time so I decided to learn as much as I could just to see what I can do and started by learning MS Office, then Photoshop a bit and in the process I also learned HTML, CSS. I tried but couldn’t get much hang of JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Once I got confident that I can write decent HTML, I switched to learning CMS and first one I tried was Joomla, and for me it was very hard to understand, I had more question then I could find answers to. So on suggestion of my husband I switched to WordPress. I was able to quickly figure things out with WordPress and set up a blog for myself.</p>\n<p>In 2010, I joined WPoets as QA. In those days I had some free time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To improve my skills I started looking into old reviews of the themes that were approved on WordPress themes repository.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This helped me understand theme file structures and various criteria to check themes for, I used skills acquired to ensure themes built by WPoets were also following these guidelines.</p>\n<p>Sometime in 2011, once I was confident that I have understood the process I joined the ‘Theme Review Team’ and started officially reviewing themes in the repository. This was a proud moment for me.  During my journey as theme reviewer I was helped and guided by Emil Uzelac, Chip Bennett &amp; Edward Caissie.</p>\n<p>In 2013, very first WordCamp was organised in Pune and I got a chance to talk about theme review process, this was my first ever public talk, and not being very good with English I choose to speak in Hindi. It was well received and many people wanted to know how they can get their themes approved. Again in 2015, I talked about what makes themes good in <a href="https://2015.pune.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Pune</a>. Thanks to WordCamps, I got to meet <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/making-family/">Topher</a>, <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/breaking-the-silence/">Mahangu</a> &amp; <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/finding-hope-darkness/">Raghvendra</a>.</p>\n<p>Now a days, as I get less time between work and kids, instead of doing theme reviews I answer questions on WordPress.org support forum.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m an introvert and came from a small city so I&#8217;m always hesitant to talk to new people but the WordPress community give me confidence to talk with new people and in front of people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a big achievement for me and my family feels proud of it.</p>\n<p>In WP community every one ready to support and help to move forward because of this nature I love to this community. I want to emphasize the support that I have received from WordPress community in general and members of theme review team in specific who helped me gain the knowledge necessary to do my work better. I also want to thank all the organisers of Pune WordPress Knowledge Exchange meetup group, and specially <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/ill-keep-looking-for-a-cms-unless-i-find-wordpress/">Saurabh Shukla</a> who helped in improving my presentation skills for WordCamp Pune.</p>\n<p>All these happened because of WordPress community and via HeroPress platform I would like to thank everyone who makes this community rock.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Building Confidence" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Building%20Confidence&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-confidence%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Building Confidence" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-confidence%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbuilding-confidence%2F&title=Building+Confidence" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Building Confidence"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/building-confidence/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/112316-150x150.jpg&description=Building Confidence" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Building Confidence"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/building-confidence/" title="Building Confidence"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/building-confidence/">Building Confidence</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 12:00:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Nisha Singh";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"WPTavern: Automattic Clarifies .blog Landrush Process After Bait and Switch Allegations";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63947";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"https://wptavern.com/automattic-clarifies-blog-landrush-process-after-bait-and-switch-allegations";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6001:"<p>Earlier this year, Knock Knock Whois There LLC, an Automattic subsidiary in partnership with Primer Nivel, <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-to-oversee-the-sale-and-registration-of-top-level-blog-domains">won an auction</a> for around $19 million dollars to offer top-level .blog domains.

People who apply for a domain only receive it if no one else applies for it. If there are multiple applications, the domain goes through an auction process between November 14-17.</p>\n<p>As the auction dates drew nearer and Schidle didn&#8217;t receive any information concerning the auction, he contacted support. Support confirmed that his application was not successful and he received a refund on November 15th. After asking support about the auction process, Schidle was informed that chris.blog ended up on a list of reserved domains that were not available for registration.</p>\n<p>In a blog post entitled &#8220;<a href="http://chrisschidle.com/the-dot-blog-bait-and-switch/">The .blog Bait and Switch&#8221;</a>, Schidle expressed disappointment in Automattic&#8217;s lack of communication. &#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s not fair to call this bait and switch,&#8221; Schidle said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Really it was bait and refund, and certainly the situation would be far worse had they chosen to not make the application fee refundable. But still, I thought I had a chance at securing the domain. That was the logical conclusion given the terms they outlined via a successful application or winning an auction.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Other applicants <a href="https://twitter.com/cschidle/status/799287789430849536">shared similar experiences</a> on Twitter.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/cschidle">@cschidle</a> i feel your pain. they also took my $250 for my app for <a href="https://t.co/8H0dBZfKny">https://t.co/8H0dBZfKny</a> &#8211; surprisingly poor handling for a comm\'s company</p>\n<p>&mdash; Chris Yim (@cyim) <a href="https://twitter.com/cyim/status/799343938024968193">November 17, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/cschidle">@cschidle</a> I\'ve got stood up in the same manner for <a href="https://t.co/wqDOQWyF2X">https://t.co/wqDOQWyF2X</a> Full-refund and no invitation to auction</p>\n<p>&mdash; Octavian Cioaca (@octasimo) <a href="https://twitter.com/octasimo/status/799295000240648192">November 17, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/cschidle">@cschidle</a> Same thing happened to me with <a href="https://t.co/1bRlWkdtmy">https://t.co/1bRlWkdtmy</a>.

Belcastro says that as a registrar, they&#8217;re able to activate up to 100 domain names. Some of the domains were given to <a href="https://my.blog/founders/">third-parties</a> and 25 generic domains were given to WordPress.com to be shared for free with millions of users.</p>\n<p>The registrar reserved all one, two, and three-character domains from being registered. They also allowed Automattic employees to reserve a single domain each, some of which were first names.</p>\n<p>On behalf of .blog, Belcastro apologized to those who filed applications in August and later discovered the domains were not available.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many registrars started taking pre-registrations for the Landrush period as early as last August. We do realize that some users were disappointed when they discovered that the domain names they had applied for were in fact attributed as part of the Founder’s program, or reserved, and wouldn’t be possible to register or auction at the end of Landrush.</p>\n<p>We would like to apologize to these users, but as the lists of Founder domains and Reserved ones weren’t final until just before Landrush, we couldn’t communicate them to registrars in advance (there is nothing registrars hate more than ever-changing lists of reserved domains).</p>\n<p>In addition, domains were removed as well as added to the lists, and we didn’t want to take the risk for registrars to refuse applications in September for domains that would be released in October.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To mitigate the uncertainty surrounding domain availability, fees were set up in a way so that only successful registrations would be charged. This provided a way to give full refunds to those with failed applications.</p>\n<p>Schidle appreciates the company&#8217;s apology, &#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate that their reserved domain list wasn&#8217;t finalized prior to accepting applications, and that affected applicants like myself weren&#8217;t notified sooner (auctions were scheduled to begin on November 14th),&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I think they realize their mistake in handling that communication and their apology is appreciated.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 00:03:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: WordPress Passes 27% Market Share, Banks on Customizer for Continued Success";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63735";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-passes-27-market-share-banks-on-customizer-for-continued-success";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18467:"<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-brushes.jpg?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/paint-brushes.jpg?resize=960%2C510&ssl=1" alt="photo credit: Luis Llerena" class="size-full wp-image-63978" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/265GAALCWG">Luis Llerena</a>\n<p>WordPress now powers <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all" target="_blank">27.1% of all websites on the internet</a>, up from 25% last year.

At that time Automattic was secretly working on <a href="https://wptavern.com/early-reviews-show-applications-like-calypso-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">Calypso</a>, WordPress.com&#8217;s JavaScript-powered interface, but did not unveil the project until November 2015.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to say what effect Calypso has had on WordPress&#8217; market share, as the w3tech&#8217;s 27% stat covers mostly self-hosted sites. Following up with him a year later, Mullenweg estimates that less than 10% of those sites are hosted on WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It does look like about a quarter of it is using Jetpack, though, and that has grown since Calypso was released,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Remember &#8211; Calypso is for Jetpack sites as well as WP.com.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href="https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-240-interview-with-matt-mullenweg-2016" target="_blank">interview on WPWeekly</a>, Mullenweg said he is also optimistic that the WooCommerce acquisition and <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-to-oversee-the-sale-and-registration-of-top-level-blog-domains" target="_blank">Automattic&#8217;s sale and management of the .blog domain</a> extension will contribute &#8220;another 5-10% each to that market share.&#8221; In fact, there is a team inside Automattic called Team 51 that works on strategies for getting the market share to 51%.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For getting to 51% and beyond &#8211; it&#8217;s more than just blogs and more than just websites,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We need to do stores well, we need to do wikis well, we need to do real estate sites well, we need to do restaurants well &#8211; all these things that may be outside what you normally think of as a core WP experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In order to provide the best content-creation experience on the market, in any niche, WordPress has some major work to do. The software is in imminent danger of being eclipsed by newer competitors if its core features don&#8217;t improve, especially when it comes to customizing a new site. Jetpack cannot single-handedly solve WordPress&#8217; onboarding problem.</p>\n<h3>WordPress&#8217; Weakest Link Is Also Its Greatest Opportunity</h3>\n<p>In the past Mullenweg has identified customization as the weakest link in WordPress but also one of its most important areas for improvement, saying, &#8220;The Customizer is everything.&#8221; During the <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">2015 State of the Word</a> address he said, &#8220;Customization is the single biggest opportunity for improving the WordPress experience.&#8221; I asked him if he thinks the necessary improvements to make the software more competitive need to come from core itself or if commercial products could introduce game changers for the Customizer, the editor, and other problem areas of WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think to have an impact on WordPress&#8217; growth improvements to customization have to happen in core or Calypso/Jetpack, otherwise there isn&#8217;t enough reach,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter how great a commercial product is &#8211; being behind a paywall will mean it won&#8217;t reach enough people to make a dent in WP&#8217;s growth curve.&#8221; He outlined how he sees the Customizer as a critical component of WordPress&#8217; future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think the needed improvements will only come from a customizer and theme system which is flexible, intuitive, and instantaneous, which might also need to break backwards compatibility, and a post editor which leverages the same language, patterns, interface, and concepts. We need to use and adopt a React / Redux approach to the javascript, like Calypso, and rename or make irrelevant concepts like Menus which are just plain confusing to people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Customizer improvements have been a focus throughout 2016 and the feature&#8217;s small team of contributors have made major strides towards improving the underlying architecture to build upon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <em>customization</em> that is the key need here, not necessarily the existing &#8216;Customizer&#8217; interface that we have today,&#8221; <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/components/customize/" target="_blank">Customize</a> component maintainer Weston Ruter said. &#8220;The key need WordPress has is to be able to live preview more functionality in WordPress, as Helen tweeted here:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">What if instead of opposing "shoving more stuff into the customizer" we supported "adding live previews to WordPress functionality"?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Helen 侯-Sandí (@helenhousandi) <a href="https://twitter.com/helenhousandi/status/778255682462183424">September 20, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href="https://wptavern.com/customizer-responsive-preview-and-selective-refresh-to-be-merged-into-wordpress-4-5" target="_blank">Selective refresh</a> was added earlier this year in 4.5, giving WordPress the ability to preview elements without full page reloads. This is one way the Customize API addresses that &#8220;instantaneous&#8221; aspect Mullenweg outlined above.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The <a href="https://make.xwp.co/2016/04/29/customize-posts-v0-5-released/" target="_blank">Customize Posts</a> plugin is an effort to rebuild the post editor from the ground up with live preview for all changes to post data and postmeta at the foundation,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a JavaScript-first approach to the post editing experience. No more waiting for a full page reload to save a draft. No more clicking a preview button to load the post in a new window. All of the changes are saved as drafts and previewed live. It&#8217;s reusing the TinyMCE editor component.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress may be looking at <a href="https://wptavern.com/customize-posts-plugin-and-selective-refresh-are-paving-the-way-for-front-end-editing-powered-by-the-customizer" target="_blank">front-end editing powered by the Customizer</a> in the not-too-distant future. Ruter and contributors are also working towards using the Customize API to power the next generation of widgets in core, which would use JS for UI and open the door for widgets to be managed via the REST API.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Changesets, coming in 4.7, is the most far-reaching architectural improvement to the customizer since its inception,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;Changesets allow for live preview functionality to be de-coupled from the current Customizer interface. This architecture allows for live preview to be developed in other contexts, namely on the frontend and in REST API-driven apps and headless sites.&#8221; Ruter anticipates the REST API endpoints for managing changesets to come in 4.8.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-js-widgets" target="_blank">WP JS Widgets</a> project shifts widgets away from their heavy reliance on PHP and creates a JavaScript foundation in the Customizer that allows for any library to be used to build widget controls.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A control can actually be implemented using any JS technology stack,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;In the JS Widgets plugin I have a demonstration of widget controls in the customizer being built using the customizer Element, Backbone.js, and also React.&#8221; The plugin currently implements <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-js-widgets/tree/master/php/widgets" target="_blank">three core widgets</a> and contributors are working on more.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s somewhat of a &#8216;Widgets 3.0&#8217; in core, focused on what they would look like in the Customizer first,&#8221; Ruter said, &#8220;where the widget instance data is stored in a setting, and the control listens to changes to that setting and updates its UI to reflect the changes in the underlying instance data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although this particular project is being built to be JavaScript-library agnostic, Ruter said he thinks there would be value in exploring the use of React/Redux in a “Customizer 2.0” interface:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It would be great to experiment with re-implementing the Customizer UI (pane, panels, sections, controls) in React. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Weston Ruter ⚡ (@westonruter) <a href="https://twitter.com/westonruter/status/672830761872064513">December 4, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Taking the Customizer Beyond First Impressions</h3>\n<p>Ruter said he would have a difficult time proposing to build a client site that depended on the WordPress admin for site management and content authorship.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of the work we&#8217;ve done at XWP for the past few years has been building on the Customizer to provide the editorial experiences that I think are lacking in the WP admin,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;We invest heavily in the customizer because we see it as the best foundation that WordPress has to offer to provide the experiences we want to deliver to our clients.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If the Customizer is so critical to WordPress&#8217; success, it&#8217;s curious that the contributor team remains relatively small and few companies are investing in the feature specifically. <a href="https://xwp.co/" target="_blank">XWP</a> invests heavily in Customizer development and a great deal of that is prototype work in the form of feature plugins such as Customize Snapshots, Customize Posts, and several <a href="https://github.com/xwp?q=wp-customize" target="_blank">other plugin projects</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know for sure why more developers across the WordPress community aren&#8217;t doing more with the customizer,&#8221; said Ruter, who is CTO at XWP. &#8220;It may be in part a perception problem, where it has seemingly been stuck with a negative reputation. Or it could be a technology problem, where the Customizer is vastly different from other areas of WordPress being a JavaScript single-page application.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When the Customizer was first introduced it included support for &#8216;option&#8217; and &#8216;theme_mod,&#8217; followed by widgets and navigation menus a bit down the road. The WordPress community didn&#8217;t have a full understanding of the scope and capabilities of the Customizer for addressing some of the project&#8217;s chief concerns, including content authorship with live previews. Users simply saw a constrained UI they didn&#8217;t like using to customize themes. Most users had no concept of the Customizer providing the architectural underpinnings of other aspects of WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of the problem is a lack of contributors,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;But even more than that, the biggest problem is one of having a shared vision. When the WP community throws hate on customizer improvements with each new release, it&#8217;s somewhat demotivating.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If the community realized the vision behind and appreciated a full admin experience that had live preview and staging of changes, then that would make a huge difference,&#8221; Ruter said. He and contributors find it challenging to articulate the scope and they are considerably short-handed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It could be a problem with getting ramped up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But that&#8217;s been the mandate for the WP community as a whole &#8211; to learn JavaScript deeply. I say, why not learn JavaScript deeply by building on the customizer?&#8221;</p>\n<h3>GoDaddy Plans to Invest in Core Customizer Improvements</h3>\n<p>GoDaddy is a surprising company to emerge over the past couple of years as another key player on WordPress&#8217; road to 50% market share. WordPress product and service companies, along with hosts, are keenly interested in seeing the software continue its market dominance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very important to GoDaddy that WP market share increases,&#8221; Gabe Mays, head of WordPress products at GoDaddy, said. &#8220;We&#8217;re deeply invested in the success of the WordPress community, not only because many of our customers use it, but also because of what it represents.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mays reports that approximately 1/3 of all GoDaddy sites and half of all new sites are running on WordPress. With millions of customers using the software, the company took the initiative to create a new <a href="https://wptavern.com/godaddy-launches-new-onboarding-experience-for-wordpress-customers" target="_blank">onboarding experience specifically for WordPress customers</a>. I asked Mays if GoDaddy is concerned about competitors like Wix and Weebly cutting into the WordPress market share.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if &#8216;worry&#8217; is the right word, because 1) we know the problem and 2) we&#8217;re capable of addressing it,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;As a community we either care enough to fix it or we don&#8217;t. There are negative consequences associated with the latter that pose an existential threat to the community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mays has been involved with the WordPress community for the past 10 years and is working with GoDaddy to improve the new user experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of the issue we’re experiencing now is that WordPress benefitted from such strong product market fit and, subsequently, such high growth that there weren’t the typical feedback mechanisms forcing us to make things like the UX better,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;On the other hand, our competitors fought hard and iterated for every basis point of market share they have. We’re like that natural athlete that got to the top with natural talent, but now need to master the basics, get our form right, etc. to stay on top as the game changes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s new onboarding experience is a stab at improving this UX and Mays said the company has significant WordPress core improvements in the works to provide a better first-use experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m happy to say we’ll also be contributing these improvements back to core,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re happy to have had Aaron Campbell join us as our first core contributor earlier this year and we&#8217;re working on more ways to accelerate our core contribution efforts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mays said GoDaddy is planning to submit core contributions to the Customizer and related core components in the near future but would not disclose any specifics at this time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hosts benefit immensely from WordPress and as hosts we can collectively do a lot more to move WordPress forward,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;We want to lead by example here and have big plans for this in 2017.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress product and service companies are also deeply invested in the software&#8217;s success and eager to see its market share grow. Cory Miller, CEO of <a href="https://ithemes.com/" target="_blank">iThemes</a>, one of WordPress&#8217; earliest theme companies, said growth is one potential sign of WordPress&#8217; health.</p>\n<p>“As WordPress has grown, so have we with it,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;The opposite of growth is scary — it’s stagnation or decline. Many have predicted that in WordPress for a long time, but it continues to grow and push new limits, like the defiant teenager it is.”</p>\n<p>Miller said one of his concerns with competitors in the space is that they have started to cut into the lower  or lowest end of the market, &#8220;the do-it-yourselfers that many of us count as a key part of our customer base.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress is fantastic, and so are all the innovative tools and services around it, from themes, plugins to hosting,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;But I&#8217;m increasingly seeing the reason why many, on perhaps the bottom end of the market, say, &#8216;I don’t want to mess with updates, or worrying about security, or pulling 15 separate tools together to do what I need. I just want a simple website, I want everything in one bundle, mostly done for me, and so I’ll just go with SquareSpace or Weebly.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although WordPress provides so much more in terms of community and extensibility when compared to Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace, getting started is the hardest part for new users. This is where tools like Jetpack and GoDaddy&#8217;s onboarding experience are useful for giving users what they need to succeed with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Even with a strong background in HTML and CSS, customizing a WordPress site can be challenging. Your site will never feel like your home on the web if you struggle to customize it to suit your preferences. The good news is that the WordPress project lead, contributors, hosts, and product companies are working together to improve customization in different, complementary ways in order to ensure the future of the project in an increasingly competitive market.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 22:48:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"WPTavern: 2nd Global WordPress Translation Day Brings 780 Translators Together Across 133 Locales";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63915";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:108:"https://wptavern.com/2nd-global-wordpress-translation-day-brings-780-translators-together-across-133-locales";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6921:"<p>The second <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/" target="_blank">Global WordPress Translation Day</a> was held November 12 and the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2016/11/16/notes-from-the-polyglots-chats-on-november-16th/" target="_blank">stats</a> released this week show the event was an even greater success than the first one.

Xhosa is spoken by 7.6 million people, which is approximately 18% of the South African population.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Africa has a huge potential and a lot of wonderful, enthusiastic people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There will be more WordCamps there in 2017 and hopefully more activity on the translation side.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jon Bossenger and Hugh Lashbrooke, who co-organized the Cape Town event, had attendees translating WordPress into Xhosa, Sotho, and Setswana.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By the end of the day we had two translation files for these languages that we’ll be looking to submit requests to be added as locales for WordPress,&#8221; Bossenger said in his recap <a href="https://wpcapetown.co.za/2016/11/14/wordpress-global-translation-day-recap/" target="_blank">post</a>. &#8220;We’re almost halfway towards adding all 11 official languages, just in one day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Trisha Cornelius, co-organizer the WP Johannesburg Meetup, organized the in-person translation event in Johannesburg where the team made major progress and assisted the Cape Town team in getting their languages started.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We managed to get Xhosa approved in time for us to translate some strings for our translation day event,&#8221; Cornelius said. &#8220;We translated into Afrikaans (which is at over 95% so we are pushing to get to 100%) and South African English as well. People who were at the Cape Town event have volunteered to become translators for Tswana and an attendee at our event has volunteered to become GTE for Zulu.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cornelius said the excitement of live streaming and connecting with Cape Town and others around the world could have easily made for an event that spanned longer than three hours.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The biggest success was in showing people how easy translation is,&#8221; Cornelius said. She hopes the translations will make WordPress easier for more people in South Africa and help more people get onto the web.</p>\n<p>&#8220;South Africa has an interesting case in that we have a clear racial split between being multi-lingual and not,&#8221; Cornelius said. &#8220;The majority of our population speaks English/Afrikaans as a second language and I would love to see WordPress available in all 11 of our official languages so that WP users can choose to use WP in their mother tongue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cornelius said language accessibility in South Africa is less of a challenge than actual access to computers with the Internet, but they are making progress in Johannesburg to make the internet more widely available.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Especially with the prevalence of smart phones, I think having WordPress in more indigenous languages will mean that we are able to hear more of each others voices which we desperately need,&#8221; Cornelius said.</p>\n<p>Overall, the WordPress Translation Day participants translated a total of 60,426 strings, up from 40,350 in April. This includes popular plugins and themes in addition to WordPress core.

In an effort to see if the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27403">same could be done</a> for the self-hosted version of WordPress, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27403#comment:16">Payton Swick open sourced</a> Automattic&#8217;s work into a plugin and <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/customize-direct-manipulation">placed it on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>The plugin added persistent icons to show users which parts of a site can be customized when the customizer preview pane is open. After months of collaboration between Automatticians and the Customize component maintainers, the icons were merged into WordPress 4.7 and are officially called visible edit shortcuts. The icons visually inform users which elements can be edited in a theme.</p>\n<p>The icons appear when the customizer is open and directs users to settings that control an element. For example, clicking the icon next to the site tagline in the image below opens the Site Identity section of the customizer and makes the Tagline field active. Visible shortcuts are an extension of the Shift-click to edit keyboard shortcut that was added in WordPress 3.9.</p>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CustomizerShortcutButtons.png?ssl=1"><img class="size-full wp-image-63883" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CustomizerShortcutButtons.png?resize=1025%2C544&ssl=1" alt="Visible Edit Shortcut Buttons" /></a>Visible Edit Shortcut Buttons\n<p>The icon approach was largely inspired by WordPress.com which has a similar feature in its customizer. Nick Halsey, Customize component maintainer, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/10/visible-edit-shortcuts-in-the-customizer-preview/">describes in detail</a> the history of the feature and what theme authors need to do to support it.</p>\n<p>Unlike many of the theme specific updates in the past where developers can add support by using add_theme_support, supporting visible edit shortcuts is more comprehensive. Theme authors will need to add support for <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/16/selective-refresh-in-the-customizer/">selective refresh</a>, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/22/implementing-selective-refresh-support-for-widgets/">selective refresh for widgets</a>, and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/29/fast-previewing-changes-to-menus-in-the-customizer/">selective refresh for menus</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Edit shortcuts will be enabled by default for all themes, but are contingent on themes supporting selective refresh,&#8221; Halsey said. Additionally, a small amount of CSS may be required to properly position the icons.</p>\n<p>Adding visual elements that connect parts of a theme to the customizer should take some of the guesswork out of editing themes. Instead of spending time browsing through various customizer panels to edit a part of a site, users can click a button and the right customizer panel will open automatically with the settings you need. This can be especially useful for themes that have a lot of customizer sections.</p>\n<p>I tested visible edit shortcuts using the Twenty Seventeen theme in WordPress 4.7 beta 4 and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues. The team is strongly encouraging users to test with as many themes as possible. If you use a theme where the shortcut icons are not displayed, please contact the theme author, request that they add support, and refer them to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/10/visible-edit-shortcuts-in-the-customizer-preview/">the make core blog post which explains how to do so</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 08:54:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"WPTavern: Nashville to Host WordCamp US 2017-2018";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63871";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"https://wptavern.com/nashville-to-host-wordcamp-us-2017-2018";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5593:"<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nashville.jpg?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nashville.jpg?resize=1015%2C524&ssl=1" alt="photo credit: Viv Lynch Westward - (license)" class="size-full wp-image-63884" /></a>photo credit: Viv Lynch <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68894626@N00/30070498810">Westward</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p><a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp US</a> attendees are counting down the days until the event kicks off in Philadelphia in two weeks but preparations for 2017 and 2018 are already underway. Yesterday Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordcamp-us-2017-2018-in-nashville/" target="_blank">announced</a> that Nashville has won the bid to host WordCamp US for the next two years. According to Randy Hicks, one of the organizers, the new <a href="http://www.nashvillemusiccitycenter.com/" target="_blank">Music City Center</a> venue, which was finished in 2013, has been reserved from Thursday, November 30, 2017, to Sunday, December 3 but the camp will take place Friday &#8211; Sunday. The venue has confirmed the ability to host 3,000 &#8211; 5,000 attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a brand new venue that is pretty amazing but Nashville is very centrally located to handful of other cities that all have their own WordCamps,&#8221; Hicks said. &#8220;I think there are about seven camps within 4-5 hours. The WP community around Nashville is rather strong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Over the past few years the local WordPress community has grown and WordCamp Nashville sold 325 tickets at its 2016 event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been coming to the meetups since the very first one and have been an organizer since about the same time as well as John Housholder,&#8221; Hicks said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the community explode every year after WordCamp, but 2014 and 2015 have been huge growth years for Nashville as a whole and the meetup has reflected those numbers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The application process included nailing down a venue, creating a budget, and gathering specific details about wifi capabilities, room capabilities, hotel availability, and date availability. Organizers from both the Nashville team and the Denver team (another finalist) agreed that the application time frame was somewhat constrained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought the time frame between start and submission was pretty short, but I think that depends on who is submitting and how informed they are on their local venue,&#8221; Hicks said. &#8220;Ours was really hard to get information from.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Denver team had a similar struggle with locking down a venue without certainty of being able to fully book the reservation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was what I would consider to be a semi-fanatical obsession with the first weekend in December, which was flatly unavailable at the convention center here,&#8221; said Drew Jaynes, one of the organizers who applied on behalf of Denver.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To give you some perspective, at the time that we applied, March 2016, there were two available weekends left for the Colorado Convention Center &#8211; two in all of 2017. The end of August and the middle of December. To organize an event of this size on what would be considered relatively short notice for a city as popular as Denver was essentially a fool&#8217;s errand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Nashville organizing team was able to secure its venue for early December dates, but a wider range of acceptable dates might be one way for WordCamp Central to improve the process for next year. This would give more cities the opportunity to submit competitive applications, as venues that can accommodate the expected size of WCUS are in high demand in popular cities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We had a great set of communities apply so it was tough to pick just one,&#8221; WordCamp Central representative Cami Kaos said. &#8220;In the end we went with Nashville for WordCamp US 2017-2018 because it seems like a great location for attendees, they had a beautiful venue that could accommodate an event of this size as we grow, and the dynamics between both teams were a natural fit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about Nashville, the organizing team has created a <a href="http://wpnashville.com/wcus/" target="_blank">page</a> that includes some favorite local attractions and rankings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ranked within the top 10 on Cvent ’s list of Top 50 Meeting Destinations in the United States. (August 2015)</li>\n<li>Named #3 Best Convention City in the 10 Best USA Today Readers’ Choice Awards</li>\n<li>Ranked #1 Friendliest City in America by Travel and Leisure (April 2015)</li>\n<li>Listed in Collaborate Magazine’s list of the Top 12 Foodie Cities for Meetings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nashville is centrally located for a relatively short drive or flight from anywhere in the US and should have ample options for accommodation. The city won the bid to host the WordCamp out of six applicants and Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s announcement post indicates that there were multiple local communities capable of hosting the event in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Based on the other great applications we got I’m also excited about the pipeline of communities that could host it in future years as WordCamp US travels across the United States and gives us an opportunity to learn and love a new city, as we have with Philadelphia,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 21:50:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"HeroPress: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1490";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9579:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/111616-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: If we serve the people around what we\'re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop & change alongside the people we serve." /><p>My story starts in high school as a girl with a technical bent, in a small country town just as computers were becoming mainstream but well before they were in everyone’s home. (I was in high school when Apple came to school and showed off this new fangled thing they called a mouse…). We were taught BASIC and Pascal and I actually really enjoyed tinkering with programming, but no one thought to say, “Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…” I mean, I was a girl (and girls didn’t ‘DO’ computers), and no one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.</p>\n<p>The truth is I wasn’t particularly ambitious, I didn’t have any kind of clue what I wanted to be ‘when I grew up’ so I allowed myself to be gently steered by my parents into leaving school before the end of my final year when I was encouraged to apply for a job in a bank.</p>\n<p>I got the job and started in the MICR processing department, encoding cheques with magnetic text, and I finished as a teller 3 years later (and boy was I terrible at balancing the books at the end of the day &#8211; I was much better at chatting to the customers!).</p>\n<p>Financial independence was the only name of that game; for me there was very little else to recommend the job, so I saved all the money I could and took off from both the bank, and my homeland (New Zealand) in very short order as a young, naive 20 year old primed to spend the next 3 years exploring the world. And by the world, I mean the US and Europe…</p>\n<p>That first mouse had come out in 1983, WordPress was founded in 2003 and in those 20 years the world changed. While it was doing that I was at various times being a nanny, working in child care centres, working in customer support, temping, and generally &#8216;working to live&#8217; in whatever way felt right at the time. However, in 1999 I packed up my bags once again, moved from New Zealand to Australia and took a place at a performing arts school where I honed my singing and performance skills and volunteered my time to our music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And so my personal revolution began.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On what I think was the day after I graduated from that course I walked into a full time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code. It was part of my job to edit those HTML newsletters and send them out every week. I went from there to buying books about coding for the web, experimenting on my home built PC making web pages. I’m sure like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser… from there I was completely hooked.</p>\n<p>By 2004 I was working full time as a webmaster, by 2005 I was running a small business creating sites on the side of my ‘real job’ and by 2009 that small business became my full time job as I left employment to pursue my Masters Degree in Digital Communication. It was in that year I met WordPress when I moved my old Movable Type blog onto it and within a very short time I was using  WP as the CMS of choice for all my client work…</p>\n<p>Then in 2011 I stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. THAT was the thing that changed my world.</p>\n<p>I flew on a whim from Sydney to Melbourne to attend this crazy inexpensive conference I had found after a google search for ‘WordPress Conferences’. In doing so I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back to Sydney excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WP community.</p>\n<p>Building a community around WP got off to a slow start in Sydney, but from an inauspicious early WPSyd meetup in the function room of a pub (one we actually held in the dark due to a blackout) my connection and involvement took off. Before long I was helping organise that Sydney meetup and by the time I moved away from that great city it had branched into 2 meetups, and soon after, into 3. Furthermore at the end of that first year, at my second ever WordCamp, I put my hand up to help organise a WordCamp Sydney in 2012 and then as I moved interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n<p>Here’s the point.</p>\n<p>WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now…) the thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress and any other software package exists to serve people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.</p>\n<p>In organising meetups, WordCamps, and community events around WordPress,  I have found that at the end of the day it isn’t actually WordPress that matters… it’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves. Even as my career in WP has moved through coding, into team support, into project management, there too it has been the people and my connections to them in the community that have helped fuel that transition.</p>\n<p>I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself. In all of this I feel as though I’m living proof that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, I myself have been helped, resourced and connected into places I’d have never dreamed of all those years ago as a teenager playing with that first mouse… experimenting with that BASIC code.</p>\n<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger said “Help others and give something back. I guarantee you will discover that while public service improves the lives and the world around you, its greatest reward is the enrichment and new meaning it will bring your own life.” and I completely agree.</p>\n<p>Ricky Martin said “A hero is someone who is willing to help others in his or her best capacity.” Here are two very different people giving voice to exactly what I’ve found in working and serving in this great community of diverse people. This is the kind of heroism I see around WordPress, at meetups and WordCamps; it’s the kind of hero whom I want to raise up, and at the end of the day, this is the kind of hero I hope that I am.</p>\n<p>Best of all, it’s the kind of hero that absolutely ANY of us can be.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life." class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Actually%2C%20WordPress%20didn%E2%80%99t%20change%20my%20life.&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Factually-wordpress-didnt-change-life%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life." class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Factually-wordpress-didnt-change-life%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Factually-wordpress-didnt-change-life%2F&title=Actually%2C+WordPress+didn%E2%80%99t+change+my+life." rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life."></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/111616-150x150.jpg&description=Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life." rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life."></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/" title="Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life."></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/actually-wordpress-didnt-change-life/">Actually, WordPress didn’t change my life.</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 12:00:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Dee Teal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.7 Beta 4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4576";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/11/wordpress-4-7-beta-4/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1990:"<p>WordPress 4.7 Beta 4 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

After receiving a series of emails from the provider reminding him that payment was due, the provider terminated his account seven days after the invoice was overdue.</p>\n<p>Lundekvam said ordinarily he would expect his sites and servers to go offline in response to an unpaid invoice but this particular provider, which he would not identify, simply terminated his account.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I contacted the provider in good faith, knowing that any decent provider has complete backups of everything they terminate for X time after they terminate it,&#8221; Lundekvam said. &#8220;Apparently, with this &#8216;crappy&#8217; company, terminated means literally terminated. All decent backup providers have backups of their backups, and any provider with such a setup knows very well that terminating the backups at the same time as you terminate the original files is a HUGE mistake, after all, you have those backups in place just in case something is terminated wrongly or the system corrupts something. We can simply conclude with the fact that this provider didn&#8217;t do backups of their users&#8217; data and therefore would never be able to recover anything they have lost.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although Lundekvam mentioned Amazon Glacier in a <a href="https://wptavern.com/upvato-backup-service-terminated-by-storage-provider-files-may-not-be-recoverable" target="_blank">previous interview</a> as an example of how cheap storage space is, he confirmed that Amazon was not the provider in question here. &#8220;Amazon was quickly ironed out in the launch phase due to the heavy adjustments it needed to make it work exactly the way we wanted it to,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Lundekvam said he sincerely believed this backup provider was reliable and was disappointed to find out otherwise after trusting users&#8217; data with the company. Despite the misfortune and embarrassment of the current situation, he is determined to relaunch Upvato with a new provider that offers redundant backups.</p>\n<h3>Upvato to Relaunch with Improved Version that Allows Users to Define Backup Destination</h3>\n<p>Lundekvam said the new version will be launched &#8220;as soon as possible.&#8221; His team is considering firing up the current (old) version and then migrating as originally planned instead of relaunching with the new version. The improvements include a better backup algorithm and new functionality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The very new version will allow the user to define their own destination / choice of backup location, whether that be on Upvato&#8217;s servers, their own FTP / SFTP server, Dropbox, Amazon, and other providers we&#8217;re looking into implementing,&#8221; Lundekvam said. &#8220;This would make Upvato function as a mere gateway that detects and keeps your backups in sync at your favorite destination, while at the same time presenting the same awesome visual experience on the website to display the sales ad associated with the item.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lundekvam remains committed to keeping the core service free indefinitely and may add commercial upgrades if costs exceed what he is able to contribute on his own.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As long as I am able to sustain Upvato on my own, then it will remain ad-free and completely free to use,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But of course there are plans to monetize the website if we at some point need help keeping the lights on. That might be ad-generated revenue, or a premium service for premium functionality. But regardless of what we do then, the core functionality of Upvato &#8211; backing up your Envato files &#8211; will always remain free to use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In response to commenters who suspected the service of fraud and users who may be wary of continuing with the service, Lundekvam said, &#8220;Upvato is not a fraud in any way. It&#8217;s really entirely up to the user if they want to give us a second chance or not. We are a completely free service that intends to do the very best we can do make sure that we stay a reliable, good way to store and backup your Envato files.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 22:48:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.7 Improves Accessibility by Removing Alternative Text Fallbacks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63819";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-improves-accessibility-by-removing-alternative-text-fallbacks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1252:"<p>When images are uploaded in WordPress 4.6.1 that have an empty alt text value, WordPress tries to generate one based on the caption text or the image title. If the image title is non descriptive as is common with photos uploaded from digital cameras, the alt text can be meaningless.</p>\n<p>In WordPress 4.7, the caption text and the image title fallbacks have been removed.

The Cyprus-based theme company has <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/author/alexitsios/" target="_blank">16 themes on WordPress.org</a>. Wedding themes are a relatively small niche in the directory with fewer than 20 listings. This new arrival stands out from the pack with its bold colors and customizability.</p>\n<p>Many WordPress wedding themes in the official directory seem like a wedding site forced into a blog-oriented design, with lingering post meta in areas where it serves no purpose. This particular niche is where a focused, one-page design really shines. Wedding Bride features event-specific front page sections for the couple to share their story but also allows for (optional) extra pages and a blog.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/wedding-bride-screenshot.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/wedding-bride-screenshot.png?resize=880%2C660&ssl=1" alt="wedding-bride-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-60380" /></a></p>\n<p>All of the theme&#8217;s options can be found in the Customizer where users can upload a header image, personalize the header overlay, and add various content sections &#8211; all of which are optional. It also includes an option to make the navigation menu sticky or have it scroll with the page (default).</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/wedding-bride-theme-1.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/wedding-bride-theme-1.png?resize=1025%2C405&ssl=1" alt="wedding-bride-theme" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63806" /></a></p>\n<p>Wedding Bride users can customize the background color and/or image. Unfortunately, the theme does not include a color picker to customize the pink accent color, but this can be changed with a little CSS. Blog pages include a sidebar and it supports four widget areas in the footer. The contact form section was created for use with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/" target="_blank">Contact Form 7</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.platotheme.com/wedding-version/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see the theme in action. <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/wedding-bride/" target="_blank">Wedding Bride</a> is Alex Itsios&#8217; 16th theme on WordPress.org and his first foray into the wedding niche.

Freddy Lundekvam, a full time programmer and frequent user of Envato products, created the service after losing 10 files to Envato&#8217;s policy of reserving the right to take down and remove any file at its or the author&#8217;s sole discretion. Losing files is a <a href="https://forums.envato.com/t/half-of-my-items-removed/27143/3" target="_blank">common frustration among Envato users</a>, as the company cannot guarantee the ongoing availability of products due to situations like copyright complaints and technical issues.</p>\n<p>Upvato made it easy for users to automatically backup their purchases, cataloguing them with screenshots, descriptions, titles, and author information. The service offered unlimited backups and Lundekvam encouraged users to connect their Envato accounts to keep their files safe. A few weeks ago, Upvato users started to suspect that the service was shutting down.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyone using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Upvato?src=hash">#Upvato</a> for their themes etc from <a href="https://twitter.com/envato">@envato</a> &#8211; I think you have just been duped!</p>\n<p>&mdash; Andrew Wilkinson (@parysnet) <a href="https://twitter.com/parysnet/status/793135773998514176">October 31, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What happened to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/upvato?src=hash">#upvato</a>?

After experiencing problems with Upvato&#8217;s provider, he is not hopeful that he can recover the files.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our provider&#8217;s automated systems terminated everything related to Upvato,&#8221; Lundekvam said. &#8220;I am so frustrated and upset that you won&#8217;t believe it, but I am doing what I can do recover the files and or get a backup up and running. But it seems like the provider isn&#8217;t and wasn&#8217;t really a reliable backup provider at all, and as it is right now, it looks really dark for a possible chance to recover the files.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lundekvam would not specify who his provider was, but had referenced Amazon Glacier in a <a href="https://wptavern.com/new-upvato-service-offers-free-backups-for-envato-market-products" target="_blank">previous interview</a> as an example of cheap storage space at a mere $7/month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Such things shouldn&#8217;t happen with a backup provider like Upvato, and I am extremely surprised that it happened with our backup provider, causing it to affect Upvato,&#8221; he said. He also confirmed that he does not plan to shut the service down permanently.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I am unable to recover the backup and files, then no, I am not shutting down,&#8221; Lundekvam said.&#8221; I would, and have to, install Upvato with a new provider and start over. Please rest assured that Upvato is coming back up. Regarding the concerned users, I am deeply sorry for the downtime and, possibly, loss of Envato files. It hurts that it happened, as this is in no way how I want Upvato to be seen or represented.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lundekvam would not respond to subsequent inquiries. Upvato has had ample time to share this news via other outlets but the service did not have a Twitter account and its website has vanished, leaving users without any information. Lundekvam had said in previous interviews that he did not have plans to monetize Upvato in the immediate future. His motivation was to &#8220;make something cool and useful that people might want and need.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, since he treated Upvato as a side project and did not have further backups in place, an unexpected problem with his provider has wiped out the files users trusted with the service. In an ironic twist, the service has inadvertantly replicated the exact situation that users hoped to avoid with Envato. Lundekvam has not responded to further inquiries on the status of the recovery process, but we will update when any new information is available.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 21:01:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"Matt: Flying Lotus, Never Catch Me";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46928";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"https://ma.tt/2016/11/flying-lotus-never-catch-me/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:357:"<p></p>\n<p>Music videos are themselves an art form, and it&#8217;s always interesting to me how an artist chooses to transform the interpretation of their song with the video.

This impacts the SVG loading time, depending on how many emoji you are using, and can even throw warnings on Google&#8217;s <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank">PageSpeed Insights</a> tool. Turkey-based WordPress developer <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/m_uysl/" target="_blank">Mustafa Uysal</a> has just released <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/compressed-emoji/" target="_blank">Compressed Emoji</a>, a plugin that makes use of the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/emoji_svg_url/" target="_blank">emoji_svg_url</a> filter introduced in 4.6. This filter allows developers to change the URL for where emoji SVG images are hosted.</p>\n<p>When the plugin is activated, the compression offers savings in the range of 3kb ~ 1.3kb (roughly %60) per emoji.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/emoji-compressed-comparison.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/emoji-compressed-comparison.png?resize=1025%2C511&ssl=1" alt="emoji-compressed-comparison" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63717" /></a></p>\n<p>Uysal said he hopes WordPress.org will consider compressing emoji in the future, especially since approximately 10% of the web is using WordPress 4.6. Compressing emoji is a small way to speed up a sizeable chunk of the web. A <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37374" target="_blank">ticket</a> was created on Trac four months ago, requesting cache headers for emoji files and compression. According to Gary Pendergast, the change is something that can be made outside of the WordPress core development cycle, so he closed the ticket and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/systems/2016/07/20/there-are-no-cache-instructions/" target="_blank">passed the suggestion on to the Systems team</a>. Cache headers were added by the team, but compression was not implemented in that update.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The current plan is to move everything to a new CDN,&#8221; Gary Pendergast reported after chatting with the Systems team. &#8220;The current CDN is a bit outdated &#8211; they don’t support HTTP/2, for example. They need to do some more testing, but it’s high on the todo list.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, users who want compressed emoji can use Uysal&#8217;s plugin. It compressed the files using <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo" target="_blank">SVGO</a>, an open source Node.js-based tool for optimizing SVG vector graphics files. The tool removes unnecessary things like metadata, comments, hidden elements, and default or non-optimal values from the SVG files without affecting their rendering.

Baio&#8217;s media and technology blog has been a continual source of original content about life on the internet and how it affects our culture. The migration includes 472 posts and 15,891 entries from his sideblog <a href="http://waxy.org/category/links/" target="_blank">Waxy Links</a>.</p>\n<p>Waxy.org played a small part in WordPress.org&#8217;s early history. In 2005 Baio broke the story about <a href="http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/" target="_blank">WordPress quietly hosting search engine spam articles</a> in order to help cover some of the site&#8217;s expenses. The exposure and subsequent removal of <a href="http://random.waxy.org/html/google_wordpress.html" target="_blank">the articles</a> temporarily decimated WordPress.org&#8217;s pagerank but Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="https://ma.tt/2005/04/a-response/" target="_blank">response</a> to the situation brought more transparency to how the open source project was being funded. Baio interviewed Mullenweg for the piece and considered it his first foray into serious journalism.</p>\n<p>In his post about the site&#8217;s redesign Baio concedes that blogs are &#8220;not really part of the cultural conversation anymore&#8221; but said he thinks there&#8217;s still potential in the medium.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There a few reasons why I’m sad about the decline of independent blogging, and why I think they’re still worth fighting for,&#8221; Baio said. &#8220;Ultimately, it comes down to two things: ownership and control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Baio explained why it&#8217;s important for him to control his own space on the web, as opposed to putting content at the mercy of third-party platforms whose futures are not guaranteed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Last week, Twitter announced they’re shutting down Vine. Twitter, itself, may be acquired and changed in some terrible way. It’s not hard to imagine a post-Verizon Yahoo selling off Tumblr. Medium keeps pivoting, trying to find a successful revenue model. There’s no guarantee any of these platforms will be around in their current state in a year, let alone ten years from now.</p>\n<p>Here, I control my words. Nobody can shut this site down, run annoying ads on it, or sell it to a phone company. Nobody can tell me what I can or can’t say, and I have complete control over the way it’s displayed. Nobody except me can change the URL structure, breaking 14 years of links to content on the web.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://waxy.org/" target="_blank">Waxy.org</a> is now responsive and uses a custom theme built using Automattic&#8217;s <a href="http://components.underscores.me/" target="_blank">Components starter-theme generator</a>. Baio will continue exploring odd corners of the internet on his blog and plans to share his thoughts about the challenges of navigating the ecosystem of independent publishers.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 23:45:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"WPTavern: bbPress 2.5.11 Adds WordPress 4.7 Compatibility";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=63694";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"https://wptavern.com/bbpress-2-5-11-adds-wordpress-4-7-compatibility";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2494:"<p>The bbPress development team has <a href="https://bbpress.org/blog/2016/11/bbpress-2-5-11-maintenance-release/">released 2.5.11</a> to add support <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/07/changed-loading-order-for-current-user-in-4-7/">for a technical change</a> in WordPress 4.7. Users are highly encouraged to update to bbPress 2.5.11 <strong>before</strong> updating to WordPress 4.7. In 4.7, the loading order for the current user in the function stack was changed to accommodate <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/07/user-admin-languages-and-locale-switching-in-4-7/">user locale switching</a>.</p>\n<p>Previously, BuddyPress and bbPress displayed a custom notice when a user was initialized without using WP-&gt;init(). In addition to patching the issue in <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7305">BuddyPress</a> and <a href="https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2309">bbPress</a>, a new <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23016">wp_roles_init filter</a> was added to WordPress that allows plugins to add custom roles when they&#8217;re initialized.</p>\n<p>The changes mentioned above are technical in nature so I asked John James Jacoby, lead developer of bbPress, what the update really means. &#8220;bbPress loads its roles on-the-fly, in a similar way to how post-types and taxonomies are registered,&#8221; Jacoby told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With locales and roles now having a reversed load order, bbPress needed some code changes to work for both WordPress 4.6 and 4.7 without causing any problems for third-party bbPress plugins and non-English installations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This particular improvement has personal historical meaning to Jacoby, &#8220;This change to WordPress core in 4.7 is a long time coming,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was the very first bug I ever reported in WordPress&#8217; IRC channel back in 2008, when I was working on a large multi-lingual multisite installation. It&#8217;s how I met Peter Westwood and Jen Mylo, and it was their kindness that made it clear that WordPress was the platform for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jacoby also notes that per-forum moderators, favorites, and subscriptions have been rewritten in bbPress 2.6. During testing, performance enhancements were discovered and submitted to WordPress core and have been implemented across the forums on WordPress.org. Work continues on bbPress 2.6 which is expected to ship in 2017.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 22:33:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 253 – BuddyPress 2.8, WordCamp US, and PressNomics 5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=63684&preview=true&preview_id=63684";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-253-buddypress-2-8-wordcamp-us-and-pressnomics-5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3135:"<p>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, <a href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I discuss the news of the week.

This will be the first time the event has been held outside of the United States, a change that makes it more accessible for contributors who are unable to obtain a visa to enter the U.S.</p>\n<p>Attaching the summit to WordCamp Europe was the next logical step, as the event brings together project contributors from around the world. Europe is one of the fastest growing regions for the WordPress community in terms of events, with a <a href="https://wptavern.com/europe-tops-wordcamp-growth-in-2015-with-70-increase-in-events" target="_blank">70% increase in WordCamps in 2015</a>. There were 20 WordCamps held in October and 50% of those were hosted in European cities.</p>\n<p>The past three community summits have been invitation-only in order to ensure those present were active contributors to WordPress and to enable a format that facilitates face-to-face discussions on key issues facing the project and the community. This inevitably leaves many valuable contributors on the outside. In an effort to mitigate the sense of exclusivity around the event, the WordPress Community Team is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/11/03/wordpress-community-summit-2017/" target="_blank">proposing a new selection process for 2017</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If we have to limit our attendance to have productive, collaborative discussions at the Summit, then choosing the participants becomes a challenge if we don’t know what the teams are going to discuss ahead of time. Therefore, this year I suggest we try something new:</p>\n<p>Let’s ask teams to decide on the challenging, controversial, or sensitive issues they want to discuss at the summit before the summit is held. Then, once the teams know what they want to talk over in person, they can nominate and select the people needed to represent all points of view in each of those discussions. This way, the event stays small, hard topics get discussed, but the selection process is more transparent and functional.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Rocio Valdivia, who posted the proposal on behalf of the team, roughly outlined how the selection process would work. She suggested each make.wordpress.org project team would create and publish a list of topics/issues for discussion at the summit and submit them by December 20th. Teams would then select representatives to attend the summit. Two members of those selected would be assigned to help with the organization and logistics of the summit, including tasks such as finding sponsors, travel assistance, and communication.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The intention of this approach is to propose a more open and team-focus Community Summit with transparent participation from all active contributors and reps of each team,&#8221; Valdivia said. &#8220;This way we can hopefully anticipate barriers and cross-team difficulties that might come up, and avoid them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This approach is different from past events where attendees were not part of the organizational aspects but it gives contributors more ownership of the event and their teams&#8217; specific goals. Details and logistics would be worked out later in the year with the help of the WCEU organizers.</p>\n<p>The Community Team is asking for feedback on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/11/03/wordpress-community-summit-2017/" target="_blank">proposal</a> before implementing a plan of action for the new selection process. As the open source project has grown, WordPress has hundreds of contributors spread across its three dozen core <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/components/" target="_blank">components</a>. So far contributors have weighed in on the initial proposed number of team representatives and the deadline for preparing topics.</p>\n<p>There was also some concern in the Community Team&#8217;s meeting on Slack as to whether the new selection process will perpetuate the pattern of the same people being invited to the summit every time simply because they are most active in the project. Allowing teams to nominate their representatives based on the anticipated topics will make the selection process more focused on which contributors are best suited to work on pressing issues. Moving the location to Europe will also give regional contributors the opportunity to bring fresh ideas and perspectives, especially regarding the challenges of multilingual publishing with WordPress.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 06:48:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"bbPress: bbPress 2.5.11 – Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://bbpress.org/?p=178971";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"https://bbpress.org/blog/2016/11/bbpress-2-5-11-maintenance-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1075:"<p>bbPress 2.5.11 is out, and is a maintenance release for all previous 2.x versions. 2.5.11 includes support for the soon to be released WordPress 4.7.

You could skip the commute, bring your laptop and charger, and power through your to do list from anywhere, wherever you are.\n\nWorking remotely – whether from home, Starbucks, or another creative place – is booming.

Beauty: <a href="https://www.avon.com/">Avon</a></h3>\nPerhaps the best-known and most-storied of the direct-selling opportunities, Avon has built an incredible business on the “Avon Lady Model.” Sell Avon beauty products, from lotion to lip gloss, to your friends and neighbors in exchange for the freedom of setting your own hours and working from home. <a href="http://www.marykay.com/">Mary Kay</a> is another skincare and makeup company that offers the opportunity to build your own business in this way.\n<h3>25. Jewelry: <a href="http://www.stelladot.com/">Stella &amp; Dot</a></h3>\nThis jewelry company has a “flexible entrepreneurship” model for stylists: host in-home or online trunk shows to display jewelry to friends. Flexibility and stye in one! If this doesn’t fit your style, there are several jewelry companies providing this type of remote job opportunity including <a href="https://www.chloeandisabel.com/">Chloe &amp; Isabel</a> and <a href="http://trend-tribe.com/">Trend Tribe</a>.', 'The Top 25 Sites For Finding Remote Jobs', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-top-25-sites-for-finding-remote-jobs', '', '', '2014-10-12 18:07:34', '2014-10-12 18:07:34', '', 0, 'http://localhost:8888/starter/?p=26', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(28, 1, '2014-10-12 18:08:57', '2014-10-12 18:08:57', 'When starting a web site or a blog of any kind on WordPress there are certain plugins that can make your life 1000x easier. Not only will they save you time, but plugins can bring your site to the next level by making it more usable, searchable, and innovative.\n\nSo what is this magical “plugin” we speak of? A plugin is simply a program that you can install to add a <em>specific</em> feature to your website. For WordPress, these plugins are written in PHP and integrate seamlessly with your site.\n<h2>Installing A Plugin</h2>\nInstalling a plugin can be a little bit tricky if you haven’t done it before. First, log in to your WordPress admin page (https://[yourdomain.com]/wp-admin). From the admin dashboard, look to the left sidebar menu. There is an option on that menu to choose called “Plugins.” Click it! You’ll open the plugins settings tab. From here, there are two main ways to install:\n<h3>1.  Search for a plugin in the plugins library</h3>\nWhen you open the plugins setting tab, there is a search box on the main page. Type in the name of the specific plugin you are looking for, or a keyword (i.e. “SEO”) to find a list of options. You can also search by popular, new, favorites, or pre-determined keywords. Once you search, a list of matching results will appear. Research them by clicking “details” or install right away by clicking “install now.”\n\n<a href="http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.23-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21682 aligncenter" src="http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.23-PM-1024x375.png" alt="Search for Plugins" width="584" height="213" /></a>\n<h3>2. Upload your plugin</h3>\nYou can download a plugin as a .zip file to your computer, and then upload it to your site. Click the “upload” tab in the top navigation on the plugins settings tab, choose the file, and voila! Your plugin will upload and install for you. An important note is that you can only upload files in .zip format, so if you get an error message, check that!\n\n<a href="http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.46-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21683 aligncenter" src="http://4b93n32qwvjj3ddn5w3yhffoas6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-01-at-2.13.46-PM-1024x221.png" alt="Upload plugins" width="584" height="126" /></a>\n\nEvery plugin is slightly different with the setup required once it is installed – some require none at all, and others require a bit of work. Click into your plugin once you install it to make sure you follow the correct steps to get it up and running!\n<h2>Must Have Plugins</h2>\nAs you will see, there are thousands of plugins to choose from. What makes a plugin a must-have? Here’s the criteria we like to use at Skillcrush:\n<ul>\n  <li>Will the plugin make your site faster?</li>\n <li>Will the plugin reduce spam?</li>\n <li>Will the plugin help you better accomplish your site goals?</li>\n</ul>\nWe scoured to find you a few wonderfully helpful plugins that will accomplish just that!

In her book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Successful-People-Breakfast-Mornings-ebook/dp/B007K3E2YK/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=marandang-20" target="_blank">What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast</a></em>, Laura Vanderkam writes, “Seizing your mornings is the equivalent of that sound financial advice to pay yourself first.  If you wait until the end of the month to save what you have left, there will be nothing left over.  Likewise, if you wait until the end of the day to do meaningful but not urgent things like exercise, pray, read, ponder how to advance your career or grow your organization, or truly give your family your best, it probably won’t happen.”\n\nEven if you have never considered yourself a morning person, you are going to have to figure out how to work around that as some of the most successful people in the world attribute a lot of their productivity to a stellar morning routine. Check out these kings and queens of technology and their amazing morning routines.\n<h3>Padmasree Warrior,  Cisco Chief Technical and Strategy Officer</h3>\nCan you say early riser? Warrior <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/the-daily-routine-of-17-ceos.html">wakes up at 4:30 a.m</a>., reads email for an hour, checks out the news, exercises, and gets her son ready for school. She is in the office by 8:30 at the latest and starts her workday.\n<h3>David Karp, Founder of Tumblr</h3>\nThe 28 year old founder and CEO of Tumblr, puts off checking his email until he gets to the office around 9:30 am, unlike many of his CEO colleagues. I guess he is of the philosophy that you should not start your day by checking email. As <a class="opennew" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/201106/the-way-i-work-david-karp-of-tumblr.html" target="_blank">quoted in <em>Inc. Magazine</em></a>, “Reading e-mails at home never feels good or <em>productive</em> . If something urgently needs my attention, someone will call or text me.”\n<h3>Steve Jobs, late Apple CEO</h3>\nJobs spent his mornings re-evaluating his work and his goals in life. <a class="opennew" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/steve_jobs_how_to_live_before_you_die.html" target="_blank">In his speech to a graduating class at Stanford</a>, Jobs said:\n<blockquote>“For the past 33 years I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”</blockquote>\n<h3>Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo</h3>\nMayer is another early riser. We aren’t sure of the time but she has admitted she really doesn’t need much sleep to thrive (between <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/successful-people-who-barely-sleep-2012-9?op=1">four and six hours of sleep on any given night</a>). Of course, this is also the woman who said <strong>t</strong><strong>here are 130 hours of potential work time in a week if you shower strategically.</strong>\n<h3>Jason Goldberg, CEO of Fab</h3>\nGoldberg is definitely of the school of thought that working out first thing in the morning makes you productive for the rest of the day. According to research, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1095783/People-exercise-work-days-happier-suffer-stress-productive.html">published in the <em>International Journal of Workplace Health Management</em></a>, on exercise days, people’s mood significantly improved after exercising. Goldberg told Inc., “I start my day at 6 every morning, and the first thing I do is check overnight emails. Our technology team is based in India, so they’re ahead of us. After I respond to any urgent emails, I do my morning run on the treadmill at a full steep incline for 30 minutes. I try not to think about work. Instead, I watch TV shows on my iPad. Currently, I’m watching “Curb Your Enthusiasm”–I’m up to Season Six. My other favorite shows are “Top Chef”, “Dexter”, and “Mad Men”.”\n<h3>Alexa Von Tobel, CEO and Founder of LearnVest</h3>\nVon Tobel is also in support of a morning workout followed by a plan to the minute day. She told <a href="http://observer.com/2014/04/learnvest-founder-alexa-von-tobel-q-and-a/#ixzz33mpMd9Om" target="_blank">The Observer</a>:\n<blockquote>“I start with an early morning workout (whether a power walk with friends, barre class or spin class), which is critical to feeling energized for the whole day. My calendar is often scheduled down to 15-minute intervals, so I can (attempt to!) make time for everything — internal and external meetings, speaking events, interviews, etc. I try to put as much as possible on auto-pilot (ex: using shortcuts like eating basically the same thing for breakfast and lunch). Also, I like to tackle the hardest things first, so I think through my priorities the night before and make sure I have time for my most strategic work.

You have a lot on your plate – starting hectic morning routines anew, helping with homework, packing healthy lunches, managing after school activities, WHEW.  And of-course during all this you’re probably wondering if your kids are learning the right things at school and how you can supplement their education at home.\n\nYou’ve no doubt heard about the importance of computer literacy and getting your kids into programming and coding. But with the abundance of apps, toys, and books available, it’s hard to know where to start. Here are my top 4 choices for parents looking to get their young ones into tech:\n<h3>1. <a href="http://www.gethopscotch.com/" target="_blank">Hopscotch</a></h3>\nThis iPad app lets kids drag and drop functioning blocks of code to build their own programs. The app teaches kids programming fundamentals as well as critical thinking and problem solving skills in a creative environment. The app fosters a “learn by experimenting” attitude and encourages kids to play and try things and see what works. Hopscotch was actually inspired by Scratch, # 3 on this list. Hopscotch cofounders Jocelyn Leavitt and Samantha John hope to get girls into programming earlier and help fill the void of women in tech.\n<h3>2. <a href="http://www.helloruby.com/" target="_blank">Hello Ruby</a></h3>\nWe love everything about Linda Liukas and her upcoming children’s book Hello Ruby. The book raised $100k in 24 hours on Kickstarter and more than exceeded its initial goal of $10k by raising just over $380k at the end of its campaign. The book aims to teach 4-7 year olds about programming and open source culture through a smart, mischievous female protagonist and her whimsical adventures. Parents get a workbook so they can learn and help their kids solve problems in the accompanying activity book. We interviewed Liukas at the completion of her Kickstarter project – <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2014/02/21/skillcrush-linda-liukas-rails-girls/" target="_blank">you can read that interview here.</a>\n<h3>3. <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a></h3>\nScratch is a brainchild of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at MIT’s Media Lab. It’s a programming language and comes with an extensive online community of it’s own. It’s designed for kids aged 8-16 and is totally free to use. Scratch allows students to create their own animations, interactive stories and much more. It uses drag and drop blocks of code similar to Hopscotch.\n<h3>4. <a href="http://www.tynker.com/" target="_blank">Tynker</a></h3>\nI learned about Tynker from my old boss, who’s wife Tanya homeschools their 3 kids. Tynker provides self-paced courses with tutoring baked right in. Their tutorials are interactive and fun for kids, allowing them to unlock achievements and badges, create customized projects and characters and build video games while they learn programming concepts. Sharing projects on the web with others is a big focus of Tynker’s and they hold summer camps to foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing. They occasionally run <a href="http://www.tynker.com/blog/articles/tynker/a-room-full-of-girls-coding/" target="_blank">workshops exclusively for girls</a> as well.\n\nAre you an old hat at getting kids into tech?

(37, 1, '2014-10-12 18:15:01', '2014-10-12 18:15:01', 'When I launched <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2014/06/05/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org/www.crandlecakes.com">my blog</a> in 2012, I went about it like this: I Googled “WordPress blog,” clicked <a href="http://zh.wordpress.com/">a button</a> that said, “get a free blog,” and I started rolling.\n\nA year later, I realized I should have done more research. I wanted to change my site layout and add functions (like a hovering Pinterest button), and I realized (oh nooos!) I needed a “WordPress.org blog” for that.\n\nGetting a “WordPress.org blog,” it turns out, really means downloading the free, open-source <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress web software</a> and using a third-party hosting service (like GoDaddy or Bluehost) to get your site online.\n\n<a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>, on the other hand, takes care of all that legwork for you. You don’t worry about hosting or serving up files, and your blog comes with a free domain that looks something like this: <a href="http://www.myblog.wordpress.com/">www.mynewblog.wordpress.com</a>.\n\nBut when you hand over responsibility, you also lose control: your WordPress.com site will show ads unless you pay a yearly fee, and many upgrades, like hosting videos or buying a custom domain name for example, can get costly.\n\nTo add to the new-blogger confusion, when you’re working on your blog, the Dashboard (the place where you edit your blog from the back end) looks almost exactly the same no matter which avenue you take. Because WordPress.com runs on the same WordPress software as a self-hosted site, the user experience after setting up your blog isn’t that different.\n\nDeciding between starting a free WordPress.com blog and self-hosted WordPress site is as simple as deciding how much freedom you want over your site’s look and feel, how much behind-the-scenes work you’re willing to do, and whether you want to monetize your blog.\n\n<a href="http://howtomakemyblog.com/wordpress-com-org/"><img title="WordPress.com Vs WordPress.org Comparison" src="http://makemyblog1.how2make.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress.com-vs-org.jpg" alt="WordPress.com Vs WordPress.org Comparison" width="800" height="1723" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>1. How much control do you want over your site’s look and feel?</h2>\nIf you’re okay with an “out of the box” theme [http://theme.wordpress.com/], WordPress.com might work for you. For an extra charge, you can customize some features, like fonts and background colors. Overall, though, you are limited when it comes to changing the design of your site.\n\nIf you’re looking at those themes and thinking, “but I want my Instagram feed up higher and I’d like social media buttons above the top navigation,” you’ll want to go with a self-hosted WordPress blog so you can access your site’s layout and HTML.\n<h2>2. What extra functionality do you want on your site?</h2>\nRemember that anecdote about the Pinterest hover button I wanted? WordPress.com is always updating and adding new features, but you will have more control on a self-hosted site. Through WordPress.org, you’ll have access to libraries of plugins [https://wordpress.org/plugins/] that can add features like interactive calendars, social media sharing options, and RSS feeds–not to mention, Google Analytics–to your site. And by accessing your site’s code, your opportunities to add to and embellish features are unlimited.\n<h2>3. Do you want to monetize your site?</h2>\n“Oh wow, I have so many pageviews! Maybe I can make a little cash with ads!” Nope. Not if you’re on a WordPress.com site. They’re giving you a lot for free; it’s no surprise that you can only sell ads in WordPress-approved ways. On a self-hosted site, however, the world is your oyster…or, you know, your sales floor.\n\nIn addition, while, WordPress.com recently introduced new ways to sell on your site, eCommerce is more established and flexible with a self-hosted site.\n<h2>4. How much can you spend?</h2>\nSelf-hosting is an upfront cost that ranges from a few dollars a month to closer to hundreds per year. But using a free WordPress.com blog and adding a lot of additional features can get pricey. Infographic cost comparison:<a href="http://howtomakemyblog.com/wordpress-com-org/">http://howtomakemyblog.com/wordpress-com-org/</a>\n\nWhen it comes down to it, WordPress.com is a valuable tool for users looking for a free option, who don’t need to customize or make money off of their site. But getting a self-hosted site through WordPress.org provides the most flexibility, freedom, and opportunity for growth. And let’s face it, you’re going to want to use this site to become a moneybags, and WordPress.org allows more freedom for turning your hard work into cold hard cash.', 'WordPress.com or WordPress.org?

How I managed to learn how to code and immediately start making money with my coding skills, while continuing to learn?</p>\n<p dir="ltr">The answer is simple: <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2013/08/01/wordpress-for-fun-profit/wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">WordPress is one of those incredible <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2012/08/29/open-source-software/">open source</a> gifts that just gives and gives and gives some more. And for the beginning coder who wants to keep learning new programming skills while making some money, WordPress is hands down the way to go.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">For those of you not familiar with the platform, WordPress is an open source <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2012/05/01/cms/">content management system</a> built in PHP. Originally, WordPress was designed for blogging. But now, thanks to the creation of custom post types and the hard work of thousands of WordPress plugin developers, the platform can do much, much more.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">I, like most developers, built my first website using HTML and CSS. Shortly thereafter, a good friend of mine suggested that I look into hacking around in WordPress. What he explained to me is that WordPress was a great content management system, and could be a good way for me to get familiar with some basic programming concepts like templating, working with loops, learning about database, and more fun things like that, while also building cool custom websites.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">He spent 30 minutes explaining to me how the application is set up and where to look for more information, and that was it, I was off to the races. Me and my new friend WordPress soon became inseparable.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">For a good year or so after that, I had a great side hustle going building marketing and content publishing websites with what can only described as an <em>extremely</em> limited tech skillset.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Now, I look back at the websites I created with WordPress before I really knew anything about programming with a mix of horror and amazement.</p>\n<p dir="ltr">But honestly, I really shouldn’t be embarrassed because though they weren’t particular programmatically exciting, WordPress made it easy to build extremely robust custom marketing and content publishing websites even with only a small set of skills. Four years later, many of <a href="http://blog.papertiger.org/">the websites</a> I built are <a href="http://www.campbaco.com/">still alive</a> and <a href="http://companyb-ny.com/">going strong</a> (wow did I love big rounded buttons or what?).</p>\n\n<h5>The top five reasons why you should learn how to build in WordPress:</h5>\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Do nothing, and you’ll still have a great website</strong>\nWordpress comes out of the box with arguably, one of the best content management systems in the world (thank you open source &amp; the power of hundreds of people working together on one web application). Now, there is still a learning curve and some people do complain that the WordPress backend is a little too complicated, but honestly, as someone who has done a lot of work with other systems (and seen what it looks like when you try to building something as robust as WordPress from scratch), they really have worked out a lot of the kinks!</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Chances are, someone else has already solved any problem you run into</strong>\nOne of the best parts of WordPress is that you have access to a HUGE library of open source <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/">WordPress plugins</a> that will allow you to customize the CMS in all manner of ways. If you find yourself wanting to add some functionality to your site that isn’t native to the platform (a slideshow, a contact form, a facebook login) chances are someone else has wanted to add that functionality and already done the hard work for you. And all you have to do is install the plugin!</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. When you are lost, WordPress has the best docs</strong>\n<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page">The WordPress Codex</a> is seriously the most amazing, wonderful, searchable group of docs every created for any open source project ever. Anyone who has worked with other open source web applications or content management systems (*cough* Drupal *cough*) can tell you that the WordPress documents are spectacularly thorough, clear, and easy to use. If this is your first experience, know you are being seriously SPOILED.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Did we mention the 5 minute install?</strong>\nOh, by the way, WordPress is incredibly easy to install on your local machine (let me introduce you to my friend <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WAMP</a> and <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">MAMP</a> and the famous, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">5 minute WordPress install</a>), and is supported by practically every web hosting service in the world. In fact, major web hosts like GoDaddy and <a href="http://hostgator.com/">HostGator</a> offer fancy things like “1-click” WordPress installation services that will have you up and running in a matter of seconds.</p>\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. And most importantly, knowing how to hack WordPress is known to lead to some serious CA$H\n</strong>Last, but not least, knowing how to customize WordPress is a seriously marketable tech skill. There are many many freelancers and companies that have built entire careers on hacking WordPress. Just ask our friend <a href="http://skillcrush.com/2013/04/05/zoe-rooney/">Zoe</a>!</p>\n<p dir="ltr">Have I convinced you that WordPress is awesome? Fantastic!
